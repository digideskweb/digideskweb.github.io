	<h3>Hello World</h3>
	<p>Welcome to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> Engineering! We assume if youâ€™ve arrived at this page, you probably already know all about the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, and likely some of the other <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">Q&amp;A sites</a>. In addition to writing a lot of code, we like to write about writing code and the other things we're doing to improve the tech community. We're trying a new thing by collecting those writings here so we can share them with the larger programming community. We hope you like it!</p>
