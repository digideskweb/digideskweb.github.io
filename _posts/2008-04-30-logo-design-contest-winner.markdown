Our [logo design contest](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php/2008/04/logo-design-contest/) has ended.



The winning design is from [Peter Borlace](http://web.mac.com/peteborlace/pbdesignsolutions/welcome.html), aka [pb_design](http://99designs.com/users/241303).

There were a whopping **253 entries** in the contest; thanks to everyone who participated for your hard work. As a little bonus, [Leon Bambrick](http://secretgeek.net/) has graciously offered up free licenses to his excellent [TimeSnapper](http://www.timesnapper.com/) software to the following runners-up:



[Umasankar Arumugam](http://99designs.com/users/245213)

[Kamil Zadora](http://99designs.com/users/245217)

There were many excellent entries, but it came down to a difficult decision between these four which we felt best captured the intent of stackoverflow.com.



I'll be awarding the $29 prize to Peter first thing tomorrow. Congratulations!
