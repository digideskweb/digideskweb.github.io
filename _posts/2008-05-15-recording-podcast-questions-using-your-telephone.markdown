If you want to submit a question for the next podcast, it must be in audio format. If you don't have an easy way to record your question, here's how. Use the [BlogTalkRadio Cinch service](http://blog.blogtalkradio.com/2008/02/18/podcasting-is-a-cinch-with-blogtalkradio/):







  1. Call **(646) 200-0000**

  2. Talk

  3. Get the RSS feed at http://cinch.blogtalkradio.com/YOURPHONENUMBER




I just tried it, and it really works! I called 646-200-0000 from my cell phone, talked, hung up, then navigated to **http://cinch.blogtalkradio.com/510620xxxx** in my web browser:

The resulting mp3 file is 32 kbps, 11 kHz. There's a small "blog talk radio!" intro added, then whatever you said on the telephone.



[Listen to my sample mp3](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/cinch-stackoverflow-recording.mp3) (43kb)



Just call 646-200-0000, talk, hang up, then visit the URL to download your freshly created mp3 audio file -- and mail it to us at [podcast@stackoverflow.com](mailto:podcast@stackoverflow.com). It really is that easy!



Thanks again to **Tim Patterson** for turning us on to this cool and free service!
