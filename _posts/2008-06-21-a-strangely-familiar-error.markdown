Geoff Dalgas, the newest member of the Stack Overflow team, shared **this strangely familiar error message** he ran into while working on another project recently.

Ah yes, [the elusive stack overflow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow):





<blockquote>
In software, a stack overflow occurs when too much memory is used on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack">call stack</a>. In many programming languages the call stack contains a limited amount of memory, usually determined at the start of the program. The size of the call stack depends on many factors, including the programming language, machine architecture, multi-threading, and amount of available memory. When too much memory is used on the call stack the stack is said to overflow; typically resulting in a program crash. This class of software bug is usually caused by one of two types of programming errors: <strong>infinite recursion</strong>, or <strong>very large stack variables</strong>.
</blockquote>





You know what'd be really ironic, though? A stack overflow on Stack Overflow. Maybe that [should be our 404 page](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000819.html).
