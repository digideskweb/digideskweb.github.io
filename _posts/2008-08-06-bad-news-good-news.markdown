I've got some bad news and some good news.



I like to start with the bad news, and you don't get a choice, so here goes:



**There will be no podcasts for the next two weeks.**



Joel is on an extended vacation. Our apologies, but the logistics of recording remotely are too daunting.

Plus, we want Joel to _enjoy_ his vacation, right? Me, I don't get a vacation. I have to work frantically with Jarrod, Geoff, and Jeremy on this Stack Overflow thing. Not that I'm bitter or anything. I'll just [set my desktop background](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000963.html) to something tropical. It's almost the same thing as a vacation. _Almost._



But, I also bring you the promised good news!



**You can sign up for the Stack Overflow beta**.



Hooray! Huzzah! Because who _doesn't_ love using buggy, incomplete websites filled with irate users?

I asked around on Twitter and got a recommendation for a [Google Spreadsheet Form](http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2008/02/stop-sharing-spreadsheets-start.html). I looked at Wufoo and SurveyMonkey but their limits are too low. I must say I'm impressed with the Google docs spreadsheet form solution; it's working amazingly well. And it's so simple. Every time someone [visits the form](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=pKxDW35algYdxrCnzW-OLag) and signs up, a new row is created in the spreadsheet. Easy!
