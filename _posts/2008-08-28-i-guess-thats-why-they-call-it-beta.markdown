Just a quick note to the beta participants:



We apologize for the recent spate of outages. We're currently diagnosing a sporadic hang in the website that we haven't quite got a handle on yet.  Until we figure it out, we're forced to restart the web service every few hours.



I'll update this post when we get it licked, but until then, expect a bit more turbulence than usual. We appreciate your patience.



Edit: Problem solved; [see Podcast #20 for explanation](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/09/podcast-20/).
