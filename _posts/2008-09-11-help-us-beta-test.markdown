If you'd like to help us beta test Stack Overflow, in advance of the Monday launch, here's how:







  1. Go to [beta.stackoverflow.com](http://beta.stackoverflow.com)

  2. Enter "twitter@twitter.com" and "falkensmaze" to gain access (note that _this is NOT an account_: it's merely a password to gain access to the beta)

  3. Please do bear in mind [the beta test guidelines](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/07/stack-overflow-private-beta-begins/).




When asking questions, try to keep them on topic:







  * Is your question about **programming**?

  * We prefer questions that can be _answered_, not just discussed.

  * Provide details, but write clearly and simply.




I thought these guidelines were straightforward, but they haven't stopped anyone from asking anything they damn well please. Every time I visit the site, I half expect to see "How do I make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?"



If you're wondering what's so special about Stack Overflow, the answer is -- well, nothing, really. It's a programming Q&A; website. The only unusual thing we do is synthesize aspects of Wikis, Blogs, Forums, and Digg/Reddit in a way that is somewhat original. Or at least we think so.

Stack Overflow is that tiny asterisk in the middle, there.



But hopefully you'll see what I mean when you experience it for yourself.
