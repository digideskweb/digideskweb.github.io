Geoff, Jarrod and I recently [recorded an episode of Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=152) with [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/).

This is similar in tone to [Stack Overflow podcast episode #17](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/08/podcast-17/) with the development team. So if you enjoyed that one, you'll probably like this episode of Hanselminutes!
