I noticed that our friends at [UserVoice](http://uservoice.com) now support [OpenID](http://openid.net/):

This means you can (finally) log into both sites (stackoverflow.com and [stackoverflow.uservoice.com](http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com)) using the very same OpenID. I believe they're using [RPXNow](https://rpxnow.com/how_it_works) to implement this feature.



Hooray for open interoperability, and open identity standards!



So I guess that's what Richard was hinting at when we interviewed him on [Podcast #30](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/11/podcast-30/).. who knew? :)
