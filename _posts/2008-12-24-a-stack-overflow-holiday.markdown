Joel and I started recording a podcast yesterday, but we belatedly realized things are quite slow as this is a holiday week. We decided to **postpone until next week** so we'd have meatier topics to discuss. Thus, no Stack Overflow podcast this week.



But I do have a bit of good news -- I am planning a little holiday present for the most avid Stack Overflow users.

If you have a Stack Overflow reputation of **10k or greater**, you _might_ just find a present waiting for you on the site, sometime over the next couple days!
