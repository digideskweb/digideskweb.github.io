Over the last few months, I've noticed a few users that have been exceptionally active on the [Stack Overflow UserVoice feedback site](http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/).



![uservoice: top users by activity](/images/wordpress/uservoice-top-users-by-activity1.png)



I have extended **UserVoice moderator privileges** to [Joel Coehoorn](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3043/joel-coehoorn) (it's pronounced koo-horn) and  [Sean Massa](http://stackoverflow.com/users/106/endangeredmassa).



I wasn't kidding when I said this in the [Stack Overflow FAQ](http://stackoverflow.com/faq):





>
At the high end of this reputation spectrum there is little difference between users with high reputation and moderators. That is very much intentional. **We don't run Stack Overflow. The community does.**






These two guys have gone _far_ out of their way to help other users on UserVoice who have run into Stack Overflow bugs and issues. We think they've earned the right to speak as **[adjunct](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/adjunct) members** of the Stack Overflow team.





>
_adjunct_ (adjective)

> 
> 

>   1. Added or connected in a subordinate or auxiliary capacity: an adjunct clause.

>   2. Attached to a faculty or staff in a temporary or auxiliary capacity: an adjunct professor of history.







From now on, UserVoice responses from Sean or Joel will be similar to responses from [the core team](http://stackoverflow.com/about). As highly active users on both Stack Overflow and UserVoice, they're in an excellent position to help, and they'll have a close dialog with us to help resolve any issues or concerns that they've identified.



A big thanks to _everyone_ who participates on the [Stack Overflow UserVoice site](http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/). I -- and I mean this quite literally -- couldn't do it without you.



You can expect to see more changes on stackoverflow.com along these same lines, in the very near future.
