[Simucal](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2635/simucal) asks:





<blockquote>
What is SO's peak time of day in terms of number of users on the site?  I'm curious because there are times when I want to ask a fairly niche question and asking when the most number of users are on might be beneficial.
</blockquote>





I did a quick query on non-deleted revisions, grouped by hour of day GMT time. Here's what I came up with.

Looks like the most popular time to post is between 15:00 and 22:00 GMT/UTC, at least for all Stack Overflow data between launch and today.



You'll have to convert those GMT hours to your local time zone, of course. For the USA, that's:



<table width="400" >
<tr >
<td >Eastern Standard Time
<td >GMT/UTC minus 5 hours</tr>
<tr >
<td >Central Standard Time
<td >GMT/UTC minus 6 hours</tr>
<tr >
<td >Mountain Standard Time
<td >GMT/UTC minus 7 hours</tr>
<tr >
<td >Pacific Standard Time
<td >GMT/UTC minus 8 hours</tr>
</table>



I'm a PST guy, so for _me_ that means the best time to post a question I needed an answer to ASAP would be at the beginning of this activity peak -- very early in the morning, probably around 7 AM to 8 AM. Ugh.
