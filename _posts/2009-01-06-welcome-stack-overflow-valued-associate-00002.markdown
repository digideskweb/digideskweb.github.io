I am pleased to announce that **Stack Overflow just added another team member in an officially paid capacity: [Jarrod Dixon](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3/jarrod-dixon)**.



![welcome-jarrod-dixon-stackoverflow-valued-associate-002](/images/wordpress/welcome-jarrod-dixon-stackoverflow-employee-002.jpg)



Jarrod and I met on the job in 2002, and became fast friends. Here was the rare programmer who loved to code every bit as much as I did. It was our calling, and we recognized that in each other almost immediately.

I wasn't sure exactly why we got along so well, until we went to one of those corporate teambuilding events that [Paul Graham loves so much](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html).  During the event, the moderator had everyone go to a corner of the room, depending on whether you were..







  * the oldest child in your family

  * a middle child in your family

  * the youngest child in your family

  * the only child in your family




Of the entire room of 30+ people, only Jarrod and I ended up in the "only child" corner. Our coworkers sadly shook their heads and agreed: _this explains a lot._



It was always our goal for Stack Overflow to be a modest but self-sustaining business. Bringing Jarrod on as **Stack Overflow Valued Associate #00002**, there to work daily on the site alongside me, is an important milestone toward this goal. In a (very) small way, I want to do what Joel did: build a [fantastic environment](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/12/29.html) for programmers to work on interesting problems. OK, so the fantastic environment isn't quite there yet, but I do [put my money where my mouth is](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000666.html): we've already bought Jarrod a Mirra chair, a blazing fast desktop computer, and a 30" monitor.



Just for the record -- and I am not trying to put a guilt trip on anyone, I'm just explaining the way things are -- **pretty much all the Stack Overflow advertising revenue that comes in goes _directly_ to Jarrod's salary**. True story. This is the way I want it. In all honesty, nothing makes me happier than paying my dear friend -- who also happens to be an incredibly talented developer -- to work on this project with me. And with you! Having Jarrod on board means we can satisfy [top rated UserVoice requests](http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/) much faster, and build cool new stuff into the site with greater regularity.



(also, not to be be crass, but if you're interested in advertising on Stack Overflow do [drop us an email](mailto:ads@stackoverflow.com). Help us feed a fellow programmer!)



Now, Stack Overflow is bigger than Jarrod and I; it's only through the contributions of [our entire team](http://stackoverflow.com/about) that we've gotten to where we are today. I do hope to bring on more of our excellent team in a formally paid capacity as we continue growing the site. Gotta crawl before you can walk.



2009 is shaping up to be a great year for Stack Overflow. We have big plans. I'll be blogging about them shortly. We need your input, because we know it isn't _about_ us -- [Stack Overflow is You](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/11/stack-overflow-is-you/).
