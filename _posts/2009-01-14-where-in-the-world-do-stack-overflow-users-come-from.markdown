Someone asked **what the breakdown of Stack Overflow users is by country** -- on Stack Overflow. I [didn't think it was a particularly appropriate question](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/a-question-about-questions/), because it's a poll, a meta-question, and not even really a poll about _programming_ per se. Sort of a triple whammy.



But I'm happy to answer here on the blog, with a breakdown of Stack Overflow traffic by country, courtesy of [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/), accounting for **all traffic since our mid-September 2008 launch**:

<table width="300" >
<tr >
<td >United States
</td>
<td align="right" >36.3%
</td></tr>
<tr >
<td >United Kingdom
</td>
<td align="right" >8.5%
</td></tr>
<tr >
<td >India
</td>
<td align="right" >7%
</td></tr>
<tr >
<td >Canada

<td align="right" >5.1%
</td></tr>
<tr >
<td >Germany

<td align="right" >3.7%
</td></tr>
<tr >

</td></tr>
<tr >
<td >Netherlands
</td>
<td align="right" >2.1%
</td></tr>
<tr >
<td >France
</td>
<td align="right" >1.9%
</td></tr>
<tr >
<td >Sweden
</td>
<td align="right" >1.8%
</td></tr>
<tr >
<td >Italy
</td>
<td align="right" >1.6%
</td></tr>
</table>



There's definitely a long tail to this graph, if you consider that the top 10 countries only make up 71% of the total.
