The long-awaited Specialist badges are now working; you can browse them on [the badges page](http://stackoverflow.com/badges).

After I worked with it for a while, I realized that these are just tag-based badges, so I dropped the "Specialist" name and stuck with the name of the tag as the badge name.



There are two levels:



<table cellpadding="4" width="300" cellspacing="4" >
<tr >
<td >Silver
</td>
<td ><strong>400</strong> upvotes
</td></tr>
<tr >
<td >Gold
</td>
<td ><strong>1000</strong> upvotes
</td></tr>
</table>



... for **non-community-wiki answers** on questions with the specified tag.



I was originally going to include community wiki answers in the calculations, as badges have historically ignored that designation. I changed my mind, however, when I saw the huge number of silver and gold "subjective", "fun", "off-topic", etc etc badges this would create. :)
