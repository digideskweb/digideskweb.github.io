At [our first "live" podcast for MIX09](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/jeff-and-joel-at-mix-09-live-podcast/), the developers at [Woot!](http://www.woot.com/) cleverly converted [the Stack Overflow podcast drinking game](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/309517/when-to-drink-when-listening-to-stack-overflow) into **Stack Overflow podcast bingo**, and handed out cards for everyone to play along.

Hilarious -- hopefully someone scored a bingo during the live podcast! Click to see it larger.
