Stack Overflow has exactly four moderators: Joel, Jeff (me), Jarrod, and Geoff. It's no coincidence that the list of moderators is identical to the list of co-founders and mainline developers.



As we launch the upcoming IT / SysAdmin sister site, we've had very little luck locating notable folks from that community to act as moderators and spiritual leaders for the site. So **we're flirting with the idea of promoting users with high reputation scores and the respect of the community to moderator status**.



Moderators (indicated by the small star icon) are the most highly trusted members of the system, so this is not something we take lightly. Moderators can:







  * cast one-shot binding votes on open, close, delete, and offensive.

  * edit anything in the system, including user profiles.

  * delete revisions.

  * have visibility into our internal error logs.




.. and so forth. 



It occurred to me that we might as well test this theory out by starting with Stack Overflow itself. So let's give this a shot. Reply in the comments, nominating up to _three_ Stack Overflow users you think would make good moderators. Some ground rules:







  1. Must be a currently registered Stack Overflow user in good standing

  2. Must have **at least 7,000 reputation** (I was going to say 10k, but as long as you're in the ballpark, that's fine.)

  3. Should exhibit **patience** and **fairness** at all times in their questions, answers, and comments.

  4. Should lead by example, showing **respect for their fellow programmers** in everything they write.

  5. They should want the responsibility. Nominating users isn't the same as an obligation. It's purely voluntary.




The nomination period will last for one week. At that point, I'll tally the nominations up and put it to a public vote -- but only registered Stack Overflow users with a reputation score of 200 or higher will be able to cast votes!



update: voting is [now open](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-moderator-voting-now-open/) from May 6 until May 13.
