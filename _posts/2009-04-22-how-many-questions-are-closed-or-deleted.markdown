Based on the discussion about [The Stack Overflow Question Lifecycle](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/the-stack-overflow-question-lifecycle/), which I'd characterize very broadly this way...





>
[Programming Related](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/a-question-about-questions/) Question -> Answers!

> 
> 
[Non-Programming Related](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/10/a-question-about-questions/) Question -> Closed -> Deleted (eventually, depending)






... I thought it would be a good idea to couch the discussion in terms of actual _data_. Here's a breakdown of all the Stack Overflow questions and answers to date:



<table cellpadding="4" width="400" cellspacing="4" >
<tr >
<td >
<td align="right" >
<td align="right" >Closed
<td align="right" >Deleted</tr>
<tr >
<td >Questions
<td align="right" >150,433
<td align="right" >5,900
<td align="right" >9,794</tr>
<tr >
<td >Answers
<td align="right" >625,734
<td align="right" >n/a
<td align="right" >55,765</tr>
</table>



The number of closed questions is not quite 4% of all questions ever asked. 



Remember that we do not require any form of registration; we allow totally anonymous users to ask whatever they want. Even a [hard-line inclusionist](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/adventures-in-delclusionism/) would agree that **_half_ of those closed questions _should_ have been closed** as obviously not programming related, spam, or garbage. (Also, if you are a dogmatist who thinks no Stack Overflow question should _ever_ be closed for _any_ reason, Stack Overflow is probably not the right website for you.)



So that means when we cast close and open votes on a question, we are disagreeing about **one question in every fifty**.
