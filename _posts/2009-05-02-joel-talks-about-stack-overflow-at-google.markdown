On April 24th, Joel Spolsky gave a talk at Google on Stack Overflow. The talk was recorded and is [available for viewing on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWHfY_lvKIQ).







The talk highlights how, from the very beginning, we designed Stack Overflow to be a destination page for web search. We **explicitly optimize for "drive-by" programmers who type a problem into a search engine**; we're not big on social features, and we don't demand that users create an account and hang out on the site. Most of all, it's about the _information_ -- solid answers to useful programming questions!
