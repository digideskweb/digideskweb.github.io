As mentioned on March 20th, we are [looking for a new Stack Overflow moderator](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/nominate-a-new-stack-overflow-moderator/) to be chosen by the Stack Overflow community itself.



I walked through the first 30 comments to that post and gathered up the nominations (except the self-nominations and those who recused themselves), and voting is now open:



[http://stackoverflow.com/users/vote-moderator](http://stackoverflow.com/users/vote-moderator)







  * To be eligible to vote, you must be a Stack Overflow user with **200 reputation**.

  * The list of candidates is shown in random order every time it is presented.

  * Only one vote can be cast per user. (no, it can't be undone.)

  * After a week, the candidate with the most votes will be elected the new Stack Overflow moderator.




For those users who don't follow the blog, we are planning to send out a user alert (similar to the badge award alerts) tomorrow to let them know the voting page is available.






Remember, we're looking for a good moderator; someone who is above all







  * patient and fair

  * leads by example

  * shows respect for their fellow programmers in their actions and words




I suggest examining the candidates' user pages to get a sense of what kind of moderator they might make.



I cast my vote; have you [cast yours?](http://stackoverflow.com/users/vote-moderator)
