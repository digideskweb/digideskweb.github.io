Joel mentioned this in passing on one of the podcasts, but I didn't want to steal his thunder, so I'll [let him explain](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/05/12.html):





>
We decided to launch a series of Stack Overflow events: the first gathering of the tribe of great developers making Stack Overflow so successful that [over 90% of questions get answered](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/joel-talks-about-stack-overflow-at-google/).

> 
> 
It’s going to be in October, in five separate cities.

> 
> 

> 
> 

>   * October 19 **San Francisco**

>   * October 21 **Seattle**

>   * October 23 **Toronto**

>   * October 26 **Washington, DC**

>   * October 28 **London**


> 
> 
In each city, we’re planning a one-day event.

> 
> 
We decided to cram as many diverse topics as possible into a single day event. Like a tasting menu at a great restaurant, we’ll line up six great speakers in each city.

> 
> 
This is not going to be just a Java conference or a .NET conference or a Ruby conference. This will be completely ecumenical. We’ll have somebody to introduce Microsoft’s new web framework, ASP.NET MVC, but we’ll also get someone to talk about writing code for Google’s new mobile operating system, Android. And in each city, we’ll find one local computer science professor or graduate student to tell us about something new and interesting in academia.

> 
> 
For smart programmers who are interested in learning about something a little bit outside of their own immediate field, this is the conference for you. We’re doing it in the spirit of Byte Magazine. Remember Byte? Every issue covered a wide range of topics and technologies. Sadly, Byte disappeared, to be replaced by Mac-only magazines, IBM-PC only magazines, even Microsoft SQL Server-only magazines.

> 
> 
The conference is for programmers. The conversation is going to be hard core. Speakers are going to be writing code.






And it's only **$99**! With a limited # of student tickets for **$10**!



Interested? [Sign up for Stack Overflow DevDays](http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/tickets.html).



Better yet ... participate!







  * We need **volunteers** in each city. If you live in one of these five cities, and would be able to help check tickets and just generally be useful during the conference, please email [devdays@stackoverflow.com](mailto:devdays@stackoverflow.com).

  * We need **sponsors** for the meals and breaks. If your company would like to be a sponsor, please email [devdays@stackoverflow.com](mailto:devdays@stackoverflow.com). This is a great way to recruit superstar programmers: sponsors will have the opportunity to set up recruiting booths at the conference.

  * If you listen to the podcast at all, you have _got_ to be sick of hearing myself and Joel ramble on by now. Save yourself, better yet, save everyone -- help us pick interesting **speakers**! Who would _you_ like to see speak in each city? [Recommend someone!](mailto:devdays@stackoverflow.com) (and yes, we are trying to get [Wil Shipley](http://www.wilshipley.com/blog/) from this week's podcast to participate at the San Francisco event.)




I'm not supposed to say this out loud, but if those cities sell out, a little bird told me that more cities might be added to the calendar.. so pretend I didn't just say that. Because I didn't. Nope. Not me.
