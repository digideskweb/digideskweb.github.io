You know what you need? Besides a haircut, I mean? [More flair](http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Office-Space.html).

As [requested on UserVoice](http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/pages/1722-general/suggestions/15605-provide-a-blog-badge-to-show-off-your-stackoverflow-badges-), you can now embed a valuable bit of Stack Overflow (or Server Fault) flair on your own website. Like so:



















This links directly back to your user page, because [Stack Overflow is you](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/11/stack-overflow-is-you/). Yes you! Well, OK, it's _also_ a thinly-veiled scheme to get a bunch of people to link back to our website. You got us on that one.



We were inspired by Stack Overflow user [Steve Robbins](http://stackoverflow.com/users/26507/steve-robbins), who didn't just wait around for us to build this, but [built it himself](http://www.grumpydev.com/2009/01/09/stack-overflow-wordpress-widget/). This is a fine example of how [good programmers get off their butts](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000135.html) and get things done! Kudos to Steve, for filling the gap until we finally had time to get around to building our own implementation.



I'm sure we'll be doing some tweaking to the Flair over the next few days -- but in the meantime **visit the [Stack Overflow User Flair page](http://stackoverflow.com/users/flair)** to get the full details. And remember: 15 pieces of flair is the _minimum_.
