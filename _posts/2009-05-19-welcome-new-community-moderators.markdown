The Stack Overflow [moderator election](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-moderator-voting-now-open/) is now complete.



There were two users who clearly ran away from the pack in the voting: [Marc Gravell](http://stackoverflow.com/users/23354/marc-gravell) and [Bill the Lizard](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1288/bill-the-lizard). Between the two of them, they accounted for almost a third of all the 2,880 votes cast.











It was a tough choice determining such a close race -- so _we didn't!_ **Both Bill and Marc are new Stack Overflow moderators**. I've posted some [moderation guidelines](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/) and flipped the switch on their accounts.



As for [Server Fault](http://serverfault.com), that was tougher, because the community is [just starting out](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/server-fault-public-beta-nears/). None of the existing Stack Overflow team is really qualified to moderate a site intended for system administrators and IT professionals.



So we reached out to two members of the existing community who very generously volunteered their time to moderate: [Kara Marfia](http://serverfault.com/users/1803) and [Denny Cherry](http://serverfault.com/users/1674).











Eventually, once the Server Fault community matures, I expect to hold a moderator election there as well to bring another one or two online.



(One thing we haven't addressed is how long a community moderator should be "elected" for; it seems like a good idea to hold periodic elections and let other trusted members of the community both relieve the existing moderators, and bring a fresh perspective to the mix.)



At any rate, congratulations to Marc, Bill, Kara, and Denny. As always, please [use your new powers for good and not evil!](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/) Unless someone really, _really_ deserves it.
