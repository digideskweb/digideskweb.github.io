In addition to our [previous email support](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/now-showing-email-notifications/), we now offer question owners the ability to **receive email notifications of new answers to individual questions.**



It's a new option at the bottom of any question you've asked:



![stackoveflow-question-email-ui](/images/wordpress/stackoveflow-question-email-ui.png)



Ticking this box will enable global email notifications in your account preferences, and entering an email address here is _exactly_ the same as updating it in your profile. (This will soon be extended to the /ask page so you can opt-in at the time of asking, too.)



Once checked, you will get a **single daily summary email** of answers to all questions where you've checked this box. You don't even have to visit Stack Overflow to get answers -- as long as you're willing to wait until midnight GMT when the daily rollup email notifications are sent out.



And don't worry -- as with every email we send, there is a one-click global unsubscribe if you don't want to get any more emails from us.
