I've always envisioned the Stack Overflow story as a trilogy. You know, like **Star Wars**. The original, _non-sucky_ Star Wars, I mean. And now that I've secured the third domain name, we can complete our trilogy. I think the analogy works on several levels:



<table >
<tr >

<td style="width: 40%;"><img src="/images/wordpress/star-wars-poster1.jpg" alt="star-wars-poster"></td>

<td style="padding-left:10px;" valign="top" >
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com"><img src="http://stackoverflow.com/content/stackoverflow/img/logo.png"></a>

<p><h2><a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a></h2></p>

<p>For <strong>programmers</strong></p>

<p>The first. The fondly remembered classic. A model for so many sci-fi movies that followed.</p>

<td style="padding-left:10px;" valign="top" >
<a href="http://serverfault.com"><img src="http://serverfault.com/content/serverfault/img/logo.png"></a>

<p><h2><a href="http://serverfault.com">serverfault.com</a></h2></p>

<p>For <strong>system administrators</strong> and <strong>desktop support professionals</strong></p>

<p>A darker, more serious movie. Some say the best in the series.</p>

<td style="padding-left:10px;" valign="top" >
<a href="http://superuser.com"><img src="http://superuser.com/content/superuser/img/logo.png" alt="superuser-temp-logo"></a>

<p><h3><a href="http://superuser.com">superuser.com</a></h3></p>

<p>For <strong>computer enthusiasts</strong> and <strong>power users</strong></p>

<p>One word: <em>ewoks</em>. But also, Leia in a bikini. Still canon, but little odder than the earlier movies. In other words, things are going to get a little .. crazy .. in the finale.</p>

I was thrilled to be able to secure the domain name superuser.com from fellow geek (and dual-class photographer / sysadmin) [Noah Beil](http://www.noahbeil.com/). As I've mentioned before, [naming is hard](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/it-stack-overflow-update-naming-is-hard/), and it's so rare to find a name that a) I like, and b) is available. Noah had actually heard of Stack Overflow and even used it a few times to find answers to JavaScript questions; of all the offers for the domain he had gotten over the years, this was the first one he felt was a good fit. 



At any rate, **if you wanted a community where (almost) anything goes, you're about to get exactly what you asked for in the form of superuser.com**. If your question has to do with _computers_, it will be allowed there.

But then again, _so are Ewoks_. So be careful what you ask for, I guess.
