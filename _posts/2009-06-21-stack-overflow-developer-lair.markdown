Remember [Stack Overflow Valued Associate #00002](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00002/)? Me neither. Until I saw these photographs of his developer lair, that is:

Never let it be said that I don't practice what I preach -- or rather, that I don't encourage my teammates to build themselves a **proper developer lair!**



Seen here:







  * Two 30" monitors and One 21" monitor for entry into the [prestigious triple monitor club](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000740.html)

  * A Herman Miller Mirra -- someone [invested in a quality programming chair](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001146.html)

  * Microsoft Natural 4000 -- the [keyboard of the gods](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000400.html) (well, in [some religions](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001221.html))

  * Logitech G9 -- an [excellent mouse](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000977.html)

  * custom [adjustable height keyboard podium](http://www.akp-inc.com/op10.html)

  * high end [custom built developer rig](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000905.html) (8GB, quad core, velociraptor, two video cards, etc)




And of course a fast internet connection. All part of the [programmer's Bill of Rights](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000666.html)!

Now, Jarrod Dixon and I have a bit of history, so there are a few other .. "objects" .. visible:







  * Autographed picture of [Val Kilmer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000174/) as "Iceman" from [Top Gun](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/)

  * [Mola Ram and Indiana Jones Mighty Muggs](http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/02/24/cool-stuff-indiana-jones-mighty-muggs/)

  * [Indiana Jones Fertility Idol Bank](http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/cubegoodies/ad88/) (visible in previous photo, above monitor)

  * Sad first generation iPhone, soon to be replaced with an awesome new iPhone 3GS.




It's hard to decide which Val Kilmer role is our favorite -- Iceman, Chris Knight, Doc Holliday, Nick Rivers..



Anyway, just a bit of fun for the weekend, and maybe a little food for thought on the care and feeding of software developers.
