We really like the guys at [woot!](http://www.woot.com/), and not just because they're paying us to say that as a launch sponsor of [Server Fault](http://serverfault.com/).



The woot team consists of developers and sysadmins like us, who happen to deal with some hard-core scaling problems. Such as [scripters who slam their site hundreds of times a second](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/450835/how-do-you-stop-scripters-from-slamming-your-website-hundreds-of-times-a-second). Ouch! 



They also have a clever crap-selling website that we've referred to more than once for UI ideas about data presentation. It is in that spirit that woot! approached us with a clever new concept for a badge:





<blockquote>
<strong>Enthusiast</strong> -- visited the site each day for 30 days.
</blockquote>





For the period of sponsorship, we've renamed this [the woot! badge](http://serverfault.com/badges/66/woot-enthusiast). (It'll revert to Enthusiast once that period is over.) It's now functional, as 30 days has elapsed [since the Server Fault launch](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/server-fault-public-beta-launches/). So you can now identify all the addicts_enthusiasts_ who visited either site for 30 days in a row.

What I like about this badge is that **it measures a dimension of engagement that we haven't before**. For a significant proportion of the users who earned this badge, it is their very first silver badge. It's OK to reward persistence and enthusiasm! (But we don't reward it _forever_; you can only earn this badge once.)



In fact, we liked the results from the Enthusiast badge so much we added another level: **Fanatic**.

And remember, this is a continuous award: if you don't visit the site for a single day, that will "break" your streak, and you'll have to start over.

Good luck. You're gonna need it.
