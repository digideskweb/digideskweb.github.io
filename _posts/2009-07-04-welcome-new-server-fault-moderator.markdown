Last week, the first user [reached 10,000 reputation on Server Fault](http://serverfault.com/users).



That user is [splattne](http://serverfault.com/users/45/splattne).







I had already noticed Stefan from his high quality contributions to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/6461/splattne) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/splattne), where he seems like a genuinely nice guy and a true geek like us. So when he passed the magical 10k mark, I felt comfortable emailing him to ask if he'd be interested in becoming a Server Fault community moderator. Luckily for us, he was!



(One other benefit of Stefan as a moderator is that he lives in Italy. A [really beautiful part of it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_F3YWYFIyA), apparently. This gives us better time coverage for the current SF moderators who are mostly US-based.)



Anyway, **welcome to splattne**, our newest member of the growing family of community moderators!



If you're ever curious who the moderators are for a given site, they are all listed on the /about page for each one. The [about page for the meta site](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/about) is probably the best single place to look, since all moderators across our sites are _also_ moderators there.
