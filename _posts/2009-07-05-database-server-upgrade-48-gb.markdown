We are currently upgrading the database server to 48 GB of memory, which also means we have to [upgrade the operating system](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001283.html), too.



Should be done in about an hour.



OK, this is complete. Our database server not only has 48 GB of memory installed, but has _access_ to all of that memory. Finally.

And just for fun, here's a picture of our fourth server, which will be used to run superuser.com -- [as with our earlier servers](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/new-stack-overflow-servers-ready/), there's an inscription on the top. I dedicated 4 and 5 to [Jarrod](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00002/) and [Geoff](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00003/), respectively.
