## The semi-private beta for [Super User](http://superuser.com) has begun.





That's right, it is officially [Ewok Time](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/).





>
At any rate, **if you wanted a community where (almost) anything goes, you're about to get exactly what you asked for in the form of [superuser.com](http://superuser.com)**. If your question has to do with _computers_, it will be allowed there.

But then again, _so are Ewoks_. Be careful what you ask for, I guess.

To get started, [go to superuser.com](http://superuser.com) and sign up with your OpenID. Here's the password you'll need:





<blockquote>
ewok.adventure
</blockquote>





**Be sure to [visit the accounts tab of your user page](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/cross-site-account-associations/) after you join, so you can get the +100 account association bonus on Super User!** (Note that this requires at least 200 rep, so be sure to initiate the association from the site where you have at least 200 reputation.)



Leave any feedback/bugs on [meta](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/) -- just [tag them superuser](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/superuser).



Have fun -- this semi-private beta will run for approximately 2-3 weeks. Also, a little birdie told me that there _might_ be the chance for a user who distinguishes him/herself during the private beta to be elevated to Super User moderator status, _if_ the stars were to align just so...
