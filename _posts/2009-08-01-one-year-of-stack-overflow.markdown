It was one year ago today that [the Stack Overflow private beta](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/07/stack-overflow-private-beta-begins/) started.  The [first question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4) was asked at 21:42 on July 31st, 2008.



Which means we've been doing this thing _in public_ for a full year now -- it's **a Stack Overflow birthday!**



![i-hope-you-enjoy-your-birthday-infinitely](/images/wordpress/i-hope-you-enjoy-your-birthday-infinitely.png)



Some stats for our first year:







  * Three new "family" sites have launched ([serverfault.com](http://serverfault.com), [superuser.com](http://superuser.com), and [meta.stackoverflow.com](http://meta.stackoverflow.com))

  * 208 blog posts have been posted

  * 63 podcasts have been recorded

  * 258,560 questions have been asked; 932,356 answers have been provided

  * 104,213 registered accounts have been created

  * two full-time associates are on board ([Jarrod](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00002/) and [Geoff](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00003/))

  * Stack Overflow now peaks at 965k pageviews per day, and 414k visits per day.




But more important than any of this, is that I think **we've honestly raised the quality bar for getting good answers to programming questions on the internet**. There is _nothing_ more thrilling to me than clicking on a Stack Overflow family search result in my own web searches -- I know the page will load fast, and the information I seek will be right at hand. And it'll be clean, clear, and formatted well through the tireless fractional effort of programmers just like me. Oh, and I do my part too -- I vote the _heck_ out of things I find useful, and always try to leave them better than I found them, by providing more information in an answer or comment, or editing the posts for clarity. 



If this thing we've been doing for the past year has been a success, I can't take credit for that. [But you can](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/11/stack-overflow-is-you/):

This is the scary part, the great leap of faith that Stack Overflow is predicated on: **trusting your fellow programmers**. The programmers who choose to participate in Stack Overflow are the “secret sauce” that makes it work. You are the reason I continue to believe in developer community as the greatest source of learning and growth. You are the reason I continue to get so many positive emails and testimonials about Stack Overflow. I can’t take credit for that. But you can.

I learned the collective power of my fellow programmers long ago writing on Coding Horror. The community is far, far smarter than I will ever be. All I can ask — all any of us can ask — is to help each other along the path.






Nothing motivates me more than the idea that, **together, we're raising the quality of our little corner of the internet in a tiny but measurable way**. It is both a pleasure and an honor to serve the community in this endeavor, and I look forward to [many more years of the same](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001207.html).



update: Yearling badges are now being awarded. Consider that your birthday cake!
