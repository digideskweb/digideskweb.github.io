After a brief informal nomination period by the existing moderators, and a [small impromptu vote on meta](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/14417/vote-for-super-user-moderator-poll), we've settled on **our three Super User community moderators**:















Congratulations to [TheTXI](http://superuser.com/users/705/thetxi), [splattne](http://superuser.com/users/187/splattne), and [Diago](http://superuser.com/users/3981/diago)! They are all that is standing between us and [an endless armada of Ewoks](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/), so wish them luck, and try to support them in whatever way you can.



They are of course joined by [our fellow League of (web) Justice member, How-To Geek](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/howtogeek-and-stack-overflow/).







Super User comes out of [semi-private beta](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/super-user-semi-private-beta-begins/) tomorrow -- at **00:01 PST on Tuesday, August 18th**. So if you want that coveted Beta badge, [this is your last chance!](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/super-user-semi-private-beta-begins/)
