The question occasionally comes up: **what web browsers** do Stack Overflow users tend to use?



Here's a quick look at our Analytics data from June 1st - August 19th.



<table width="300" >
<tr >
<td >Firefox
<td align="right" >50.53%</tr>
<tr >
<td >Internet Explorer
<td align="right" >29.12%</tr>
<tr >
<td >Chrome
<td align="right" >9.04%</tr>
<tr >
<td >Safari
<td align="right" >7.33%</tr>
<tr >
<td >Opera
<td align="right" >2.44%</tr>
<tr >
<td >Mozilla
<td align="right" >1.15%</tr>
<tr >
<td >Konqueror
<td align="right" >0.10%</tr>
</table>



Note that within Internet Explorer, the breakdown is 45% IE7, 29% IE8, and -- this is depressing -- 24% IE6. Which means that about 7% of our overall audience is still on creaky, broken, ancient old IE6. The Firefox breakdown is primarily 3.0 and 3.5, with a smattering of older versions.



As for the **screen size** of Stack Overflow users:



<table width="250" >
<tr >
<td >1280x1024
<td align="right" >24.03%</tr>
<tr >
<td >1680x1050
<td align="right" >14.52%</tr>
<tr >
<td >1280x800
<td align="right" >14.32%</tr>
<tr >
<td >1024x768
<td align="right" >12.32%</tr>
<tr >
<td >1440x900
<td align="right" >11.57%</tr>
<tr >
<td >1920x1200
<td align="right" >8.40%</tr>
<tr >
<td >1600x1200
<td align="right" >3.24%</tr>
<tr >
<td >1152x864
<td align="right" >1.68%</tr>
<tr >
<td >1920x1080
<td align="right" >1.32%</tr>
<tr >
<td >1400x1050
<td align="right" >1.28%</tr>
</table>



Those resolutions account for about 90% of the audience -- those that report this data back to Analytics, anyway.



(Just as an aside, in case anyone was waiting for the podcast: as noted on last week's episode, there will be no podcast recording this week.)
