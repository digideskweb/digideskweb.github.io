I sort of dropped the ball on this, but sometime in the last week or two, the first user [reached 10,000 reputation on Super User](http://superuser.com/users).



That user is [John T](http://superuser.com/users/1931/john-t).







July 15th was [the first day of beta](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/super-user-semi-private-beta-begins/), and John -- as of this writing -- has 11,232 reputation. That means in about 48 days, John has produced 234 reputation per day. (Remember that bounties and accepted answers are immune to the 200/day reputation cap.)



Impressive.



It's all the more impressive when you realize that John is a mere 18 years old! (He's also Canadian, but I won't hold that against him.) Looks like we have another lifetime Super User on our hands. 



Congratulations John, and thanks for leading the charge to provide great answers on Super User!
