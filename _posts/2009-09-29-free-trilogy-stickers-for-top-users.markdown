If you're a top user on any of the Trilogy sites, I've got some good news for you. As a gesture of thanks for being such an involved member of the community, **we'd like to send you some [Trilogy stickers](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/in-stickers-we-trust/) absolutely free!**



![](/images/wordpress/stickers-near-loose.jpg)



The fine print: to take advantage of this offer, **you must be on page 1 or page 2 of the /users page** of any trilogy site.







  * [stackoverflow.com/users](http://stackoverflow.com/users)

  * [serverfault.com/users](http://serverfault.com/users)

  * [superuser.com/users](http://superuser.com/users)

  * [meta.stackoverflow.com/users](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users) (page 1 only)




 (due to strictly limited ["special edition" meta stickers](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/19857/meta-stack-overflow-stickers-are-here), you must be on page 1 of meta.) If you are a top user on multiple sites, you have my most hearty congratulations, but you can only claim stickers once, not multiple times. If we have already sent you stickers for any reason, you can't request them again.



To claim your stickers, simply **[click here to enter your address](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHJIN0FXSkE2RDJWVFNxZFVLOW9oN1E6MA)** and we'll get the stickers mailed out to you within a week or so.



Also, because not everyone reads the blog, I'll try to shoot an email tomorrow to all the relevant users to make sure they're aware of this _fabulous_ offer.



update: all stickers were mailed Tuesday, October 13th. This reflects any top user sticker requests up to October 7th, and I don't see any new ones, so I think we're complete! Enjoy your stickers -- you've earned them.
