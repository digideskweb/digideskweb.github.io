Our program for world domination through stickers is well underway. Check out the cool stuff that Stack Overflow users have [sent in for stickers](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/how-to-get-stack-overflow-stickers/) to date:

See, [Stack Overflow really is built on love, internet style!](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/i-heart-stack-overflow/)

I guess Joel wasn't kidding when he said _"just send us anything!"_ in your SASE sticker request. Let's see what other kinds of crazy things we can get up on that wall -- **[request your stickers](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/how-to-get-stack-overflow-stickers/)** by sending in, y'know, _something!_

Once you get the stickers, [post your sticker action shots](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/20570/stickers-for-stackers-i-e-post-your-sticker-shots) on meta, too!

And yes, I am still planning to send out [free stickers for top users on each Trilogy site](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/free-trilogy-stickers-for-top-users/). Things are a bit backed up at the moment, but I expect to get all the free stickers mailed out by the end of October. These were mailed October 13th.

(I suppose this is as good a place as any to mention that there will be no podcast this week due to the flurry of activity necessary to support [DevDays](http://devdays.stackoverflow.com) -- which [kicks off tomorrow in Boston](http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/events/boston/). Stay tuned for some **big** announcements within 24 hours..)
