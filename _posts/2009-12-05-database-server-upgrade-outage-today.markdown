There will be an **outage today from 5 pm - 7 pm PST** as we upgrade the [database server](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/new-stack-overflow-server-glamour-shots/).



If you're curious, we're going from 2.5 GHz to 3.33 GHz CPUs, and using the old CPUs to build a second, backup database server.



[Our last upgrade was in July](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/database-server-upgrade-48-gb/) when we went from 24 GB to 48 GB. That old pulled memory will also be used to populate the second database server.
