This **Saturday, December 19th**, from **4 PM to 8 PM PST**, all trilogy sites and the blog will be down for a spot of maintenance.



What are we doing? A few things, several of which were inspired by comments on our [Server Rack Glamour Shots](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/stack-overflow-rack-glamour-shots/):







  * Upgrading one server which does a lot of VM utility work to [Windows Server 2008 R2](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/whats-new.aspx).

  * Installing [shorter power cables](http://www.electronichouse.com/article/middle_atlantics_iec_power_cords_can_help_prevent_equipment_rack_mess/C30).

  * Installing [shorter ethernet cables](http://www.cat5ecableguy.com/).

  * Installing a [24-port gigabit switch](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833122138), which we will reverse 1U mount.

  * Adding [dual redundant daily USB hard drive backups](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/blog-outage-backup-policies/), as suggested by Joel.




This probably won't take 4 full hours, but we figured it was better to warn about more than we needed, just in case!



All done; behold the beautiful results of Geoff's hard work -- and [compare with the old setup](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/12/stack-overflow-rack-glamour-shots/).
