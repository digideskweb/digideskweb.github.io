Remember the Stack Overflow moderator elections we held last year? Sure you do!







  * [Nominate a New Stack Overflow Moderator](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/nominate-a-new-stack-overflow-moderator/) -- March 20, 2009

  * [Stack Overflow Moderator Voting Now Open](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-moderator-voting-now-open/) -- May 5, 2009

  * [Welcome New Community Moderators](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/welcome-new-community-moderators/) -- May 19th, 2009




This whole "democracy" thing really must work, because the community truly picked winners, in my opinion -- [Marc](http://stackoverflow.com/users/23354/marc-gravell) and [Bill](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1288/bill-the-lizard) have been amazing to work with and [top notch moderators](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/) in every regard. 



Based on the [explosive](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/one-year-of-stack-overflow/) [growth](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/one-million-pageviews/) of Stack Overflow, it's clear we need a third community moderator. **Head on over to the Meta topic [Nominations: New Stack Overflow Moderator](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/35583/nominations-new-stack-overflow-moderator) and let's get those nominations started!**



(while comments are always welcome, _please do not nominate anyone in the comments here_; keep it on meta so we can stay organized.)
