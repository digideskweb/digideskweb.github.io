We've appointed two new Super User moderators from the [meta voting thread](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/14417/vote-for-super-user-moderator-poll).















Welcome [Ivo](http://superuser.com/users/1548/ivo) and [Troggy](http://superuser.com/users/2553/troggy) as our newest **Super User community moderators!**



This also means that two existing Super User moderators, originally [appointed in August 2009](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/congratulations-super-user-moderators/), will be retiring.



[TheTXI](http://superuser.com/users/705/thetxi) indicated to us via email that he no longer will be able to return to the Trilogy in any useful capacity. Serving as community moderator is completely voluntary; we understand that sometime life gets in the way of such things. Doug, we'll still be here if you ever come up for air, and you're always welcome back with pony-loving arms.



[Splattne](http://superuser.com/users/187/splattne) was unusual in that he was a moderator across _two_ sites -- Server Fault and Super User. I was always a little uncomfortable asking Stefan to pull double duty. Because he's a mensch, of course he agreed, but I'm glad we can refocus so he doesn't have as much on his plate. He will of course continue to be a moderator on Server Fault, and Server Fault will hopefully benefit from the increased attention.



As always, I recommend that new moderators (or anyone interested in the topic) read through [A Theory of Moderation](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/).



And don't forget we're still [accepting nominations for a new Stack Overflow moderator](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/stack-overflow-2010-moderator-nominations/) as well.
