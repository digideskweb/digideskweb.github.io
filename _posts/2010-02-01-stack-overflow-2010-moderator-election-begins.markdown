After a [week long nomination period](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/stack-overflow-2010-moderator-nominations/), we now have our **Stack Overflow 2010 Moderator candidates.** (To be eligible as a candidate, you had to have at least 10 total upvotes in the meta nomination thread. Downvotes were not counted in any way.)



There were some suggestions that the [Single Transferable Vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) system would work better than the simple "one user, one vote" system we [used last time](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/stack-overflow-moderator-voting-now-open/#comment-21408). So, this time around, we're conducting the election a bit differently -- **you can cast _three_ votes** instead of a single vote.

Some ground rules:







  * To be eligible to vote, you must be a Stack Overflow user with at least **200 reputation**.

  * The list of candidates is shown in random order every time it is presented.

  * Only three votes can be cast per user. No, they can’t be undone. Cast votes in the order of most desirable candidates first. Your first vote has the most weight.

  * After a week, the candidate with most weighted votes will be elected the new Stack Overflow moderator.




For those users who don’t follow the blog, we are planning to send out a user alert (similar to the badge award alerts) tomorrow to let them know the voting page is available.



Remember, we’re looking for a good moderator; someone who is above all:







  * patient and fair

  * leads by example

  * shows respect for their fellow programmers in their actions and words




I suggest examining the candidates’ user pages to get a sense of what kind of moderator they might make.



I cast my vote; **[have you cast yours?](http://stackoverflow.com/users/vote-moderator)**
