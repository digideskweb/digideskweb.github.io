Late last year, I had the pleasure of meeting Kyle Wiens, who recently launched [iFixit.com](http://iFixit.com). It's a community driven site providing step-by-step self repair guides for predominantly Apple hardware:





<blockquote>
Repair is recycling! The best way to keep electronics out of landfills is to keep them working longer. Toxic electronic waste is a global problem that we are working to solve. Self repair saves you money and helps the environment!
</blockquote>





Kyle let me know that, as programmers themselves, many features of the site were "inspired by" Stack Overflow. Which we're totally cool with, since the iFixit mission of DIY self-repair guides is geek to the bone. _To the bone!_ When I asked Kyle on Twitter if he was looking for iFixit to be inducted into our [League of Web Justice](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/07/why-cant-you-have-just-one-site/), he [replied](https://twitter.com/kwiens/status/6437390641):





<blockquote>
Naw, we're not superheroes. Maybe just a sidekick. Like Robin, or ... Aqualad?
</blockquote>





Aqualad it is, then.

Congratulations Kyle and team for launching [iFixit](http://iFixit.com). We're honored to have you as our sidekick!
