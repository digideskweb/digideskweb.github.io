I am pleased to announce that **Stack Overflow just added another team member in an officially paid capacity: [Kevin Montrose](http://stackoverflow.com/users/80572/kevin-montrose)**.



![](/images/wordpress/kevin-montrose-big.jpg)



You may remember Kevin as the author of the [unofficial Stack Exchange API](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/what-would-a-stack-overflow-api-look-like/).



I didn't realize at the time that Kevin was graduating from [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/) in Houston, TX and actively looking for employment. But when I finally noticed Kevin had [his Stack Overflow Careers CV](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/kevin-montrose) linked in his profile, even someone as dense as myself was able to put 2 and 2 together -- working on an API is our highest priority, and we're looking to hire _exactly_ the kind of programmers who roll up their sleeves and say "no Stack Overflow API after almost two years? To heck with you guys, I'll just [write my own!](http://code.google.com/p/stackexchange-api/)"



(I'm paraphrasing a little -- I'm sure Kevin didn't actually say that. Or, maybe he did. I don't know.)



Kevin is still a student at Rice until May, so our desire for someone to start part time meshed nearly perfectly with his schedule. Kevin cut his teeth developing a few pending features for [careers.stackoverflow.com](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/) and we've been quite pleased with the results. He's now actively working with Stack Overflow Associates #00001, [#00002](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00002/), and [#00003](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00003/) to make sure version 1.0 of the Stack Overflow API can be as solid and complete as possible.



As a student, Kevin is working with whatever equipment he has at hand. I made sure that he got upgraded to a nice 30" monitor and a brand new, fully decked out 8 GB, Core i5 laptop. Every team I am on will religiously enforce the [Programmer's Bill of Rights](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/08/the-programmers-bill-of-rights.html).



Congratulations, Kevin. Welcome to the Stack Overflow core team. We're certainly hoping you will want to continue this part-time gig as a full-time gig later this year!



I should also note that big things are happening with Stack Overflow right now, some of which [Joel has written about](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/02/14.html). It's very exciting and I think you'll really like what we reveal, but we can't talk about the details of that yet, unfortunately. I can, however, assure you that **we're very likely to expand the core team by several more members in the near future**. And yes, we _will_ be [eating more of our own careers dogfood](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/eating-our-own-careers-dogfood/) -- that is, hiring from the Stack Overflow (and Server Fault) community. 



Remember: we're all here to build something we love together!
