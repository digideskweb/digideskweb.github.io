I'd like to announce a changing of the guard for [Super User](http://superuser.com) moderation.



First, let's extend a hearty welcome to our two new Super User moderators:















Welcome [random](http://superuser.com/users/307/random) and [quack quixote](http://superuser.com/users/12786/quack-quixote) (nee ~quack) as our newest **Super User community moderators!** They both come highly recommended, not just by me, but by their peers in [this meta nomination thread](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/43378/should-random-be-elected-a-moderator-on-super-user).



In related news, [Diago](http://superuser.com/users/3981/diago) has indicated he'd like to step down as a moderator. Thanks, Diago, for everything you've done so far -- you had arguably the most difficult moderator position with the least support from us (which was _totally_ our fault; a mistake I hope not to repeat) and you did an excellent job regardless. I completely understand and support the decision to take a break from moderating. You are welcome back as a moderator any time on my watch.



As always, I recommend that new moderators (or anyone interested in the topic) read through [A Theory of Moderation](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/) -- also, keep an eye on the following meta tags for discussion about what moderators should (or shouldn't) be doing on the [Trilogy](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/):



[moderation](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/moderation), [moderators](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/moderators), [moderator-abilities](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/moderator-abilities)



While some moderation topics are inherently a private matter between users, **we try to discuss as much of it in public as possible**. We have a reasonable set of moderation guidelines, but how we moderate continues to evolve -- and will hopefully _improve_ as we bring in new community moderators with new perspectives and new ideas.
