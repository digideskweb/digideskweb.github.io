As we embark upon the next phase of the Stack Overflow adventure -- much of which is documented in [Stack Exchange 2.0](http://blog.stackexchange.com/post/518474918/stack-exchange-2-0) -- we realized that we desperately, _desperately_ needed someone whose full time job is to engage with the community. Both on a technical level and on a human level. 



I'm pleased to announce that we've hired **our first full time community coordinator** -- [Robert C. Cartaino](http://stackoverflow.com/users/98786/robert-c-cartaino).

I can't imagine anyone better suited for this role than Robert. He's a programmer with a deep background in online community going all the way back to the modem and BBS era. He's been actively involved in practically every stage of Stack Overflow _and_ Stack Exchange, both as participant and observer. 



Robert, in other words, is _one of us_. Part city planner, part sociologist, part programmer -- focused on collectively building thriving communities on the currency of **information**, freely shared not just between ourselves, but with the entire world of the internet.



We want to **build our team by hiring from the community**, and Robert is a great example of exactly the kind of community we're trying to build -- a tribe of smart, rational, knowledgeable people who all love this stuff as much as we do.
