**The future of Stack Overflow is highly [intertwingled](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?InterTwingled) with Stack Exchange 2.0**. We want to transfer some of the "smart users who will answer anything!" community around Stack Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User to [Stack Exchange 2.0](http://blog.stackexchange.com/post/518474918/stack-exchange-2-0). Let's figure out what sites we _as a community_ want to exist, and make them happen -- together.



I [recorded a podcast with Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?ShowID=229) where I elaborate at some length on the mission of Stack Exchange 2.0. If you had misgivings or concerns about [the plan as previously described](http://blog.stackexchange.com/post/518474918/stack-exchange-2-0), I encourage you to give this podcast a listen and see if it helps clarify what it is we're trying to do together.



If nothing else, [listen to this podcast](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?ShowID=229) to hear this sentence spoken aloud by Scott:





<blockquote>
Let's say you had another Jon Skeet. A bow and arrow using, moustached Jon Skeet.
</blockquote>





Indeed. We should all be so lucky.
