Joel Spolsky recently appeared on [Episode 51 of This Week in Startups](http://thisweekin.com/thisweekin-startups/twist-51-with-joel-spolsky-2/) (aka TWiST) with [Jason Calacanis](http://calacanis.com/). Joel's segment starts at about 23 minutes in.



(This is a followup to the [Ask Jason segment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR3mCnSwkbo) of This Week in Startups back in February where Joel originally asked about how to approach VC funding in general.)



You may remember Jason from [Stack Overflow Podcast 56](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/podcast-56/). Although we don't always agree with Jason, he's a smart guy whose opinion we respect.
