I occasionally like to give away codes for Steam games via [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/codinghorror), to [Trilogy](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/the-stack-overflow-trilogy/) users with 1k+ reputation. It's my little ad-hoc way of giving directly back to the community, just for fun.



Let's switch it up a bit and see who's paying attention. **Let's give something away on the blog this time!**



Up for grabs is three six nine Steam codes for the game [Serious Sam HD: Second Encounter](http://store.steampowered.com/app/41010/).



[![](http://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/41010/header.jpg)](http://store.steampowered.com/app/41010/)



so, if you ...







  * have a Steam account

  * have **a Trilogy account with 1k+ reputation**

  * use Windows (Steam is now [cross-platform](http://store.steampowered.com/news/3569/), but this game isn't)

  * like to blow stuff up _real good_




Provide a link to your account page in the comments. (I'll assume the email in the account is the email to send the Steam activation code to.)



I want to pick a nice cross-section of users from Server Fault, Super User, and Stack Overflow. Also, please note that priority will be given to users with multiple accounts -- if you have 1k+ reputation on more than one Trilogy site, your odds go way up!



Winners picked! Congratulations to, in order of multi-site-awesomeness:
