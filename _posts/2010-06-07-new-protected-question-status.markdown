At the behest of the Super User moderators, we've instituted a new question status of **protected**. A protected question is like a [protected Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_policy) -- it **no longer allows additions by anonymous users**.



Protected questions are indicated in the standard question footer like so:





>

> 
> ## protected by {moderator name} 3 days ago
> 
> 

> 
> This question is protected to prevent "thanks", "me too!", and spam posts from new users. To answer it, you must have more than 10 reputation.
> 
> 






We needed this because some of the more popular Super User questions attracted a lot of noise from random drive-by users who didn't understand how our system works -- users who helpfully provided so-called answers like "thanks, this worked for me!" or "I have this problem too, can anyone help?" And _lots_ of them.



Just check out [one example](http://superuser.com/questions/95685/windows-7-administrator-password-lost-how-can-i-login-windows-7-without-password) of many:



[![](/images/wordpress/superuser-deleted-answers-small.png)](/images/wordpress/superuser-deleted-answers.png)



Just be thankful that these deletions you're seeing here are only visible if you have 10k rep on superuser.com.



(I should also mention that I captured this full-page browser screenshot using [a plug-in recommendation I found on Super User itself](http://superuser.com/questions/120266/how-can-i-take-browser-screenshots-at-a-higher-resolution-than-my-browser-support).)



While we used to lock these kinds of questions, that's not really what a lock was intended for. Locking a question is a bit of a nuclear option in this scenario, as locking prevents the question from getting votes, comments, or edits when the question itself wasn't even the problem.



So, in the future, **if you see a question that is attracting a lot of drive-by noise answers, please flag it for moderator attention. We'll turn on protection.** The protection bar is extraordinarily low right now -- you only need >= 10 reputation to post an answer to a protected question -- but we think this is enough to cut down dramatically on answer noise for certain unlucky, but obviously popular, questions.



(and, as always, thanks to [our hard working Super User moderators](http://superuser.com/about) for coming up with this excellent idea)
