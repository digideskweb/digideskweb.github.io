I'm pleased to announce that Stack Overflow Inc has added two more valued associates to our team:





## #00006 [Marc Gravell](http://stackoverflow.com/users/23354/marc-gravell), United Kingdom





![](/images/wordpress/bio-marc-gravell.jpg)



[Marc](http://marcgravell.blogspot.com/) is a long time elected community moderator, C# MVP, and the #2 user on Stack Overflow, as sorted by reputation. Just under some guy I've never heard of.





## #00007 [Ben Dumke](http://stackoverflow.com/users/115866/balpha), Germany

Ben is the perpetrator of the gloriously wonderful Unicornify (see [April 1 2010](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/03/reminder-its-april-1st/)), [HREF overflow](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/21600), the [not a real question](http://notarealquestion.appspot.com/) game -- as well as dozens of prescient meta suggestions and bugfixes.



You've probably noticed by now that neither Ben nor Marc live in the United States. The [last time I checked](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/where-in-the-world-do-stack-overflow-users-come-from/), only **36%** of Stack Overflow's traffic was from the USA. Where exactly do you think that other **64%** of our traffic comes from?



As I [alluded to in a recent blog post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/05/on-working-remotely.html), the way we build the Stack Exchange network should be genuinely reflective of what it _already is_ -- **websites with avid international users all over the globe**. That's why I'm so proud to have a truly international development team at last, built by [dogfooding](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/eating-our-own-careers-dogfood/) from the amazing worldwide community that has grown up around our websites.



Welcome Marc and Ben. It's an honor to serve with you in this [vast and endless sea](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/06/the-vast-and-endless-sea.html).



(Oh, and keep your eyes open, because we aren't quite done adding team members yet.)
