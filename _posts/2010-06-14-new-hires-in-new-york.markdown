The New York team has been growing, too!

New York, in addition to being the official corporate headquarters and the location of our sales team, has a development team working on two important projects. I'd like to introduce you to those members of the team.

Working on Stack Exchange 2.0, we've got [David Fullerton](http://stackoverflow.com/users/91687/david):

Both David and Emmett are veterans of Stack Exchange 1.0.

Working on [Stack Overflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/), we'd like to welcome new associates [Matt Sherman](http://stackoverflow.com/users/70613/matt-sherman):

You'll probably see David, Emmett, Matt, Jason, and Korneel hanging out on [meta](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/) and, more importantly, you'll see the great software they ship. Welcome aboard!
