Remember that [totally awesome Stack Exchange API contest](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/05/stack-exchange-api-contest/) we announced on May 23rd? Specifically, one of the rules of the contest?





<blockquote>
Your app must work against the final, 1.0 released version of the API. We’ll give you at least a week’s notice here on the blog when that’s closer to happening.
</blockquote>





Well, if you're planning to enter this contest, you might want to get a move on -- the 1.0 release of the Stack Exchange API is imminent! We plan to **bless 1.0 of the API this Friday, July 9th**.



Due to the many [Area 51](http://area51.stackexchange.com) sites we're launching, things are a bit busy. That's good news, though, for my fellow procrastinators -- it means we're extending the deadline for the API contest slightly. **We now plan to pick the contest winners in the first week of August.**



So, if you're thinking of [entering the contest](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/05/stack-exchange-api-contest/), you still have a few weeks to build something prize-worthy.
