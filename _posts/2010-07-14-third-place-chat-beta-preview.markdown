Remember that [third place concept](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/do-trilogy-sites-need-a-third-place/) I brought up a few months ago?

We're ready to give community insiders a chance to check out what [Stack Overflow Valued Associates #00006 and #00007](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/06/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associates-00006-and-00007/) have been working so hard on.

For the next 3 days, we'll be running a public beta sneak preview of our proposed "third place" for all new (and existing) Stack Exchange network sites. Let's take [the Food and Cooking site proposal](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1288/food-and-cooking) -- which is currently in private beta -- as an example. On the very first day of the private and public betas, we'd have:


    
    
         cooking.stackexchange.com
    <font color="maroon">meta</font>.cooking.stackexchange.com
    <font color="maroon">chat</font>.cooking.stackexchange.com
    



Because you not only need a place to have **intelligent Q&A; about bacon**, you need a place to talk _about_ the place, and a less formal "third place" to collaborate in real time with the fellow members of your community.

We already have the per-site metas, which work great, but we don't _quite_ have that third place ready yet. But we'd like to ... soon. That's where you come in.





  1. You must have a [Meta Stack Overflow](http://meta.stackoverflow.com) account with at least **20** reputation.

  2. Make sure you're first logged in to meta, because we use a shared cookie for authentication.

  3. Hop on over to **chat.meta.stackoverflow.com** and enter the password "gossipville".


Have fun -- and be sure to leave your feedback for us either on meta in a question tagged [chat], or in the chat itself in the appropriately named "Chat Feedback" room.

Update: beta preview complete! thanks for all your feedback.
