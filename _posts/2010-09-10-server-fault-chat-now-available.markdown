As promised, we are slowly rolling out the [third place](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/do-trilogy-sites-need-a-third-place/) across our network.

We [started](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/chat-now-in-public-beta/) with chat.meta.stackoverflow, and as [previously announced on the Server Fault blog](http://blog.serverfault.com/post/1097124976/live-chat-for-server-fault), we now have **[chat.serverfault.com](http://chat.serverfault.com)**.

You may remember we [rolled out per-site metas](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/new-per-site-metas/) across the entire Stack Exchange network, as well as for Server Fault and Super User, back in July. So from our perspective, we're completing the experience:

<table cellpadding="4" width="600" cellspacing="4" >
<tr >

<td ><code>serverfault.com</code>
</td>
<td >Q&A; for professional system administrators
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td ><code>meta.serverfault.com</code>
</td>
<td >community organization and discussion about the site itself
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td ><code>chat.serverfault.com</code>
</td>
<td >real time chat "third place" for regulars
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**[chat.serverfault.com](http://chat.serverfault.com)** is still a public beta, but we're rapidly closing in on release status. I expect we'll begin a fairly aggressive rollout of chat across all sites within 4 weeks or so -- though do be advised that stackoverflow.com will be the last site to get it because of its immense volume.
