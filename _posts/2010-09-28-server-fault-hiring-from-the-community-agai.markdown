In yet another blatant and egregious example of [hiring from the community](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/06/server-fault-hiring-from-the-community/), we've just added a Server Fault user to our team -- George Beech aka [Zypher](http://serverfault.com/users/5880/zypher).

Welcome to our two-man sysadmin team [of ninjas](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/05/one-year-of-server-fault/), George!

George will be working out of our NYC world headquarters. Read more about his and Kyle's [continuing plans for world server domination on the Server Fault Blog!](http://blog.serverfault.com/post/1191927346/server-fault-valued-associate-00002)
