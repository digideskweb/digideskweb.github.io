A few weeks ago, I presented HTML 5 Local Storage -- as featured in our [global network auto-login](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/global-network-auto-login/) -- at the [2010 Silicon Valley Code Camp](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/).

After the talk, [Mehul Harry of DevExpress](http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/aspnet/default.aspx) buttonholed me to talk about [HTML 5 local storage](http://diveintohtml5.org/storage.html) ... and everything else we've been working on over the last 6 months. 



## Part one --  14:21






## Part two -- 13:28




If you don't have the time or inclination to watch the entire 27 minute video interview, Mehul [kindly wrote up a decent set of notes](http://community.devexpress.com/blogs/aspnet/archive/2010/10/24/video-interview-with-jeff-atwood-aka-codinghorror-com.aspx) -- and there's also a much higher resolution version of the talk available there, too. (I only mirrored the interview on YouTube for convenience, as I was having trouble getting the video to play reliably from there.)

We don't have a podcast any more, but occasionally Joel and I will do speaking engagements where we discuss aspects of Stack Exchange and Stack Overflow. Anyway, if you're wondering why we make the crazy decisions we make sometimes, perhaps this will provide some insight. Or not.
