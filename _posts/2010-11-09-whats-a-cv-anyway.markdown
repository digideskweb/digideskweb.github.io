When I first started working at Stack Overflow, I wondered why the candidate’s work experience is referred to as a CV on [Stack Overflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/). I honestly thought [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) might be a European company or maybe they were just being snobs. A resume is your work experience written up on a piece of paper – job sites, employers, recruiters, and everyone else, it seems, uses “resume”.

So, what gives with [Stack Overflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/)? Why CV and not resume? I learned pretty quickly that a CV encompasses your accomplishments in a more detailed format than a traditional resume. In fact, Curriculum Vitae roughly translates as “course of my life”. It’s true that CVs are used widely in academics and medical fields as a way to list accomplishments and credentials that go beyond a specific job role. A CV is updated anytime you have something meaningful to add – maybe it’s the sales from that software you designed or a new qualification or something else awesome that you did.  Conversely, a resume is a document that you scrape together when you’re desperately looking for a new job.

A CV is more than just about your job experience and chances are most developers don’t just program at work –they likely have a blog, a website, a side project and other professional passions too. Many developers create viable products while in college or high school.  This is terrific experience to show on your CV, painting a more accurate picture of your programming expertise.

While it would be easier for [Stack Overflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/) to use “resume” like everyone else, we think your programming experience is more valuable than a 1 page list of past jobs. Plus, really, we're saving bytes by the bucket load.

PS – If you are looking for something new for the next course in _your_ life, you might want to keep in mind [Stack Overflow is looking to hire](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/Jobs/7000/stack-overflow-developer-stack-overflow) more great developers!
