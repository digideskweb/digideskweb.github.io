Over the last 2.5 years, we've identified a few problematic classes of questions that tend to get asked on our sites. Many of these are documented in our [standard set of close reasons](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/new-question-migration-paths/): exact duplicate, off-topic, subjective and argumentative, not a real question, and too localized.

However, as we launched [the great Super User experiment](http://superuser.com/), a new, previously unknown class of problematic questions emerged -- the **shopping recommendation**.

That is, on [Super User](http://superuser.com/) we began encountering questions like:


<blockquote>Macbook Air vs. Macbook Pro?<br/>
What's the best dual-band wireless router?<br/>
Dell GX280 Processor upgrade?<br/>
What RAM should I buy?<br/>
Nvidia or ATI video card?</blockquote>


These questions may seem tolerable at first glance. Isn't it our mandate to help our fellow ewoksusers? But consider the voluminous amount of information you need to even _begin_ properly answering a shopping question:



	
  * What is your budget?

	
  * Where do you live?

	
  * What are your preferences?

	
  * Which alternatives will you consider?

	
  * When do you want to buy?


Let's say the question asker provided all that information. Fat chance, I know, but let's pretend for a moment they did -- and we were able to provide the _perfect, ideal shopping recommendation_ to them. Even if that was the case, technology moves so rapidly that **the best shopping recommendations will be utterly obsolete within a year!** What's the point of a bunch of labor intensive questions that provide only temporary benefit to a limited (some might say Too Localized) audience? There isn't any. That's what we concluded, and we [explicitly disallowed](http://meta.superuser.com/questions/1103/should-we-add-a-no-shopping-recommendation-clause-to-the-super-user-faq) shopping questions in the [Super User FAQ](http://superuser.com/faq):


>Super User is for computer enthusiasts and power users. If you have a question about …

> 
> 
	
>   * computer hardware
> 
	
>   * computer software
> 

>
and it is **not about** …

> 
> 
	
>   * videogames or consoles
> 
	
>   * websites or web services like Facebook, Twitter, and WordPress
> 
	
>   * electronic devices, media players, cell phones or smart phones, except insofar as they interface with your computer
> 
	
>   * a shopping or buying recommendation 
> 

… then you're in the right place to ask your question!




**However**, there _is_ a way to ask these questions that avoids the inherent problems with shopping recommendations. For example, let's say you wanted -- as I did -- to buy a point-and-shoot camera that takes good low light photos. So we're going to ask on [photo.stackexchange.com](http://photo.stackexchange.com), naturally!

Here's one way to ask:


>**Q: What's the best low light point-and-shoot camera?**

>
A: Canon S90 and Lumix LX3.


Here's [another way](http://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/1373/what-point-and-shoots-are-good-in-low-light-conditions) to ask:


>**Q: How do I tell which point-and-shoot cameras take good low light photos?**

>
A: I strongly recommend looking for something with

> 
> 
	
>   * a fast lens (2.0 at least)
> 
	
>   * reasonable ISO handling (at least 400, but preferably 800)
> 
	
>   * the biggest sensor available
> 

>
The sum of these factors are really critical for low light situations.


The former question provides the path of least resistance: a laundry list of products I can buy without thinking about it too much. But that answer will only be valid for a year at best. The latter question may take some thinking, but its answer will be valid _forever_ … or at least until camera technology somehow shifts beyond lenses and sensors as we know them today. Thus, when it comes to shopping questions, don't ask us what you should buy -- ask us _what you need to learn_ to tell what you should buy.

If I had to summarize our network in a single word, **that word is "learning"**. People come to our sites to _learn_ about topics they are passionate about. As the old Chinese proverb goes, "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." Every question and answer ultimately should be about teaching and learning -- yes, even the shopping ones.
