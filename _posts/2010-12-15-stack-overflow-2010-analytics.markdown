As we approach the end of the year, I thought I'd roll up some statistics that people occasionally ask about.



As a baseline -- per Quantcast, [the Stack Exchange Network is ranked #364](http://www.quantcast.com/p-c1rF4kxgLUzNc) in overall USA network traffic, and [Stack Overflow itself is ranked #598](http://www.quantcast.com/stackoverflow.com).



These numbers are from Google Analytics for the period of January 1, 2010 to December 14, 2010.





## Where in the world do Stack Overflow users come from?

Compared to [last year's numbers](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/where-in-the-world-do-stack-overflow-users-come-from/), the trend here is basic globalization 101 -- more and more traffic from outside the USA over time, where the US dropped from 36% to just 30% of the total in a single year. The top 10 countries only account for **66%** of traffic overall, down from 71% last year. 





## How do Stack Overflow users find the site?





<table width="300" > 
<tr > 

<td >Google (organic)
</td>

<td align="right" >87%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >Direct
</td>

<td align="right" >6.0%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >Bing
</td>

<td align="right" >0.9%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >Google (referral)
</td>

<td align="right" >0.9%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >Reddit
</td>

<td align="right" >0.6%
</td>
</tr> 
</table> 



No, Google isn't a monopoly, they just [play one on the internet](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/02/the-elephant-in-the-room-google-monoculture.html). Just kidding! please don't hurt me mister googles





## What web browsers do Stack Overflow users use?





<table width="300" > 
<tr > 

<td >Firefox
</td>

<td align="right" >44.1%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >Internet Explorer
</td>

<td align="right" >22.7%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >Chrome
</td>

<td align="right" >22.6%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >Safari
</td>

<td align="right" >7.4%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >Opera
</td>

<td align="right" >2.4%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >Mozilla
</td>

<td align="right" >0.5%
</td>
</tr> 
</table> 



Note that within Internet Explorer, the breakdown is 60% IE8, 26% IE7, and 13.5% IE6. The Firefox breakdown is primarily 3.5 and 3.6, with a smattering of older versions. Chrome is ... all over the map, probably because by the time you read this, they've incremented the version again.



The big news here [relative to last year](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/browsers-and-screen-size-on-stack-overflow/) is the _huge_ jump for Chrome, mostly coming at the expense of IE and Firefox.





## What operating systems do Stack Overflow users use?





<table width="300" > 
<tr > 

<td >Windows
</td>

<td align="right" >74.7%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >Mac
</td>

<td align="right" >14.7%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >Linux
</td>

<td align="right" >9.5%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >iPhone
</td>

<td align="right" >0.4%
</td>
</tr> 
</table> 



We didn't report these stats for last year, but I doubt they are terribly surprising to anyone.





## What screen resolutions do Stack Overflow users have?





<table width="250" > 
<tr > 

<td >1280 x 1024
</td>

<td align="right" >18.6%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >1280 x 800
</td>

<td align="right" >14.0%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >1680 x 1050
</td>

<td align="right" >13.5%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >1440 x 900
</td>

<td align="right" >11.4%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >1024 x 768
</td>

<td align="right" >8.2%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >1920 x 1200
</td>

<td align="right" >8.1%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >1366 x 768
</td>

<td align="right" >4.3%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >1600 x 1200
</td>

<td align="right" >2.3%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >1600 x 900
</td>

<td align="right" >1.6%
</td>
</tr> 
<tr > 

<td >1152 x 864
</td>

<td align="right" >1.1%
</td>
</tr> 
</table> 



This is _very_ good news [compared to last year](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/browsers-and-screen-size-on-stack-overflow/)! What I mainly look at here is the horizontal width. We design for a fixed _minimum_ width of 1024 px and that stat declined from 12% to 8% over the last year.



So there you have it -- a profile of the average 2010 Stack Overflow user, at least for these metrics! I think this covers most of the questions I see asked on meta about our analytics, but if there are any other metrics you think might be useful to share, make a case for them in the comments.
