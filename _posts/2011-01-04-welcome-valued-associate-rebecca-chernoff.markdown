I'm pleased to announce that we're kicking off 2011 with even more new blood on the team, including [Rebecca Chernoff](http://stackoverflow.com/users/181481/rebecca-chernoff).

Rebecca will be working remotely for us from Missouri, in a hybrid role of technical evangelist and community coordinator.

If you've spent any time at all on our network -- and in particular on our (_excellent, amazing, best-in-class_, choose your superlatives, they all apply) [web chat system](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/stack-overflow-chat-now-live/) -- you've probably run into Rebecca and her unusual backwards smileys at some point. In addition to being one of our very first [pro-tem moderators](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/) for [Webapps](http://webapps.stackexchange.com), she is apparently everywhere! In fact, when we took informal polls of who from the community we should hire as another community coordinator, **she was almost universally at the top of everyone's list**, including our own list. Yes, she is that cool.

In addition to writing a whole bunch of [useful userscripts](http://github.com/rchern/StackExchangeScripts) for Stack Exchange sites and chat, Rebecca also worked extensively with the [Stack Exchange API](http://stackapps.com/) to build [StackFlair](http://stackflair.com/).

Rebecca's role is somewhat unique within the company, in that she will work with [Robert Cartaino](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/04/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00005/) as a supporting Community Coordinator, and also with the core team in a Technical Evangelist role. That is, she will assist in supporting our API and making sure the overall experience on our sites -- whether through the API or as an end user -- is as polished and smooth as possible.

Since we have 35+ sites now, and 130+ community moderators, we can sure use the help. Welcome to the team, Rebecca! (:
