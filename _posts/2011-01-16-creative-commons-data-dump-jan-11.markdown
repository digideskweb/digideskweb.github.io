[![Download from ClearBits](http://www.clearbits.net/images/btn/CB-download.png)](http://www.clearbits.net/get/1587-jan-2011.torrent)

[This month's Stack Exchange data dump](http://www.clearbits.net/torrents/1587-jan-2011), as always, is hosted at ClearBits! You can [subscribe via RSS](http://www.clearbits.net/feeds/creator/146-stack-overflow-data-dump.rss) to be notified every time a new dump is available.

Please read, this is not the usual yadda yadda! Three things:





  1. Because the dumps are quite a bit of work for us, we're moving to a tri-monthly schedule instead of monthly. Meaning, you can expect dumps every _three_ months instead of every month. If you have an urgent need for more timely data than this, contact us directly, or use the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](http://data.stackexchange.com), which will continue to be updated monthly.

  2. The attribution rules have changed to forbid JavaScript generated attribution links.

  3. As of November 2010, we enhanced the format of the data dump to include more requested fields, full revision history, and [many other pending meta requests tagged [data-dump]](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/data-dump%2bstatus-completed?sort=active). That's why the dump is so much larger, but we did break it out in individual files per site within the torrent, so you can download just the files you need.

If you'd prefer not to download the torrent and would rather play with this month's data dump in your web browser right now, check out our open source [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](http://data.stackexchange.com). Please note that it may take a few days for the SEDE to be updated with the latest dump.
