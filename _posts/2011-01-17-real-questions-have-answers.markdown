In [Good Subjective, Bad Subjective](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/), we made a pretty solid first stab at **defining a _constructive_ subjective question**, one that I've been happy with so far. 



>
Constructive subjective questions:


> 
> 

>   1. inspire answers that explain “why” and “how”.

>   2. tend to have long, not short, answers.

>   3. have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone.

>   4. invite sharing experiences over opinions.

>   5. insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references.

>   6. are more than just mindless social fun.





But the six guidelines above depend partly on the questions, and partly on the answers. They're a fine starting point for determining what a _good_ subjective question generally looks like -- but I couldn't fully explain what makes a _bad_ subjective question.

That was before I saw [Aarobot's epic meta answer on poll questions](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/75168/should-polls-be-maintained-as-community-wiki-questions-or-should-they-be-closed/75179#75179):

Is it always the fault of the questioner that the answers suck?  Do they deserve all the blame for the fact that people with nothing useful to say want to participate anyway and bring their reddit-style "tweets" into the answers?

When someone asks, [Which programming language do you really hate?](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/2846/3249), and doesn't bother to elaborate at all, that is just screaming for crap answers.  It's hard for me to begrudge any of those participants their answers (okay, maybe I begrudge them a _little_) because the question itself was so ridiculously open-ended that _any_ answer would technically be a "correct" one.

See [Best practices that you disagree with](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/14856/3249) for an example.  On Seasoned Advice (Cooking.SE), I can point to several examples of [weak questions](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/9562/41) or even [joke questions](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/9533/41) that, given an **early**, _comprehensive_ answer, did not devolve into pointless blathering.  On the flip side, I've seen questions that were definitively **not** phrased as polls that were _still_ greeted by dozens of poor-quality answers; take, for example, one of Stack Overflow's oldest: [Practical non-image based CAPTCHA approaches?](http://stackoverflow.com/q/8472/38360)

Yes, yes, it's a long post, almost TL;DR, but it's gold. [Read it anyway](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/75168/should-polls-be-maintained-as-community-wiki-questions-or-should-they-be-closed/75179#75179). You may remember Aarobot from his [previous discovery about meta-tags](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/). 

It should come as no surprise that [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/), which has been doing high quality Q&A; since 2004, figured this stuff out _years_ ago. They're a huge influence -- up there with Wikipedia in my estimation. That's why we had Josh Millard, a MetaFilter admin, [on an early podcast](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/09/podcast-22/).



I'm just kicking myself for not discovering the particular page Aarobot referenced until now. Effective immediately, the FAQ for all sites now includes **specific guidance on what a bad subjective question looks like**.

  You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page. To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly removed, **avoid** asking subjective questions where …
>   * every answer is equally valid: "What's your favorite ______?"
> 
        
>   * your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: "I use ______ for ______, what do you use?"
> 
        
>   * there is no actual problem to be solved: "I'm curious if other people feel like I do."
> 
        
>   * we are being asked an open-ended, hypothetical question: "What if ______ happened?"
> 
        
>   * it is a rant disguised as a question: "______ sucks, am I right?"
> 
    

> 
> 

> 
> 
If your motivation for asking the question is "I would like to participate in a discussion about ______", then you should not be asking here. If your motivation is "I would like others to explain ______ to me", then you are probably OK.

All based on the MetaFilter FAQ entry [My Ask Metafilter question was removed as chatfilter. What does that mean?](http://faq.metafilter.com/tags/chatfilter), with their explicit permission and proper attribution.



I realize this is a lot of rules, a lot of guidelines, a lot of thinking. But it's simpler than it looks. As Aarobot said in his post: **real questions have _answers_, not _items_ or _ideas_ or _opinions_.**
