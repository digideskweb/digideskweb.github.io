With [forty-three sites and counting](http://stackexchange.com/sites?sort=oldest), there's no shortage of communities needing attention. Thank goodness there's also no shortage of enthusiastic users willing to volunteer their time to help their communities. But once in awhile a user stands out as truly exceptional. That's why I am really excited to announce that [Dori Smith](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/351/dori) has joined us as a full-time member of our community management team.

You may have seen Dori in her role as moderator of [Ask Different](http://apple.stackexchange.com/), the Apple Stack Exchange, but she is also actively involved in the [Programmers Stack Exchange](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/), as well as [Super User](http://superuser.com/), [English Language & Usage](http://english.stackexchange.com/), and our own [meta Stack Overflow](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/).

When I talked to Dori about joining our team, she was essentially the same person that comes across on the sites: even-tempered, well-spoken, self-motivated… and _just_ outspoken enough to keep me (and the communities) on our toes.

Dori will be working out of Healdsburg, CA. Dori has a [degree in Computer Science and speaks professionally](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/dori) about a wide variety of topics. And, wow, has she ever authored [an impressive collection of published articles and books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_tc_2_0?rh=i%3Astripbooks%2Ck%3ADori+Smith&keywords=Dori+Smith&ie=UTF8&qid=1298431656&sr=8-2-ent&field-contributor_id=B000APH4B8). Throw in her deep background as an experienced speaker, teacher, trainer, and community leader, and you have someone who is custom-built to be an outstanding community manager and technical evangelist!

Dori will start out with a unique role on our team. She is going to dedicate a significant portion of her time organizing the communities to help them jump-start some of their own promotional activities. We have long wanted to get these sites organized and involved in activities like [sending users to attend conferences](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/community-conference-sponsorships/), speaker bureaus, blogger- and Twitter-outreach, sponsorships, and media relations. With Dori on the team, her experience will bring us a long way towards helping these communities excel with new and exciting programs. Welcome to the team, Dori!
