In 2003, [Fog Creek Software](http://www.fogcreek.com/) (aka Joel’s other baby) moved offices, and decided to ditch its internal T1 and look for a colocation provider. Joel [was impressed](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Peer1.html) with PEER 1 Hosting’s customer service, the shiny new data center in NYC, and PEER 1 Hosting even volunteered to host [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) – for free!

When we decided to move our Stack Exchange Network to the East Coast to [better serve our global customers](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/12/stack-overflow-2010-analytics/), PEER 1 Hosting was the logical choice because of the [success](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/08/21.html) that Fog Creek had. We began to migrate part of the data center in May of 2010, and finalized the move of all live sites from Oregon in [October of 2010](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/datacenter-migration-oct-23/). After all the sites were set up at PEER 1 Hosting, we noticed some awesome results and thus we started a discussion with PEER 1 Hosting about how to extend the same benefits to the community.

We think it’s a [win-win](http://www.peer1.com/stackoverflow)!



	
  * As an advantage of being part of the community you get an [awesome data center at a discounted price](http://www.peer1.com/stackoverflow) – Win!

	
  * The more business Peer 1 Hosting does with people in the community, the more support they can provide to power Stack Exchange – Win!


Here's a look at our servers hosted at PEER 1 Hosting:
