Greg lives on Long Island with his wife and stays busy chasing after his two rescue dogs, Frankie and Jed.  Frankie is an active Border Collie Mix and Jed is a 75lb German Short Haired Pointer who thinks he's a lapdog.  Greg is a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan, and enjoys all things sports-related.  When not following the worst "best" team in baseball, Greg enjoys travelling, and listening to live music.

Welcome to the team Greg!
