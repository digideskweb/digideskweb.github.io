[Guy Zerega](http://stackoverflow.com/users/738643/guyzee) joins the Stack Exchange team in the NYC headquarters as Sales Manager of Stack Overflow's [Careers 2.0](http://careers.stackoverflow.com).  In this role, Guy will lead the sales team in acquiring new hiring companies and continuing to develop relationships with current customers.

Guy enjoys spending time outdoors, but especially surfing and cycling.  Okay, so maybe "enjoying" surfing and cycling is a bit of an understatement.  Guy is a competitive cyclist, and has surfed in Costa Rica, Mexico, Australia, Barbados and Puerto Rico.

When "trapped" indoors, Guy enjoys reading, music, movies and any of Showtime's dysfunctional behavior series (Nurse Jackie, Shameless and Californication).  Guy is a proud father of a 15 year old son and 12 year old daughter.
