The FAQ has contained [one key bit of advice](http://stackoverflow.com/faq#questions) from the very beginning:

<blockquote>
  It’s also perfectly fine to ask and answer your own question, as long as you pretend you’re on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!"><em>Jeopardy!</em></a> -- phrase it in the form of a question.
</blockquote>

So …





  * if you have a question that you already know the answer to


  * if you'd like to document it in public so others (including yourself) can find it later


  * it is OK to ask, and answer, your own question on a relevant [Stack Exchange site](http://stackexchange.com/sites).



To be crystal clear, **it is not merely OK to ask and answer your own question, it is _explicitly encouraged_**.

I do it all the time! For example, when I ran into a nasty issue with Java exploits in Google Chrome when browsing for images, I [documented that on Super User by asking and answering my own question](http://superuser.com/questions/201613/disable-java-plugin-in-google-chrome). Now, others can benefit from my misfortune -- and best of all, I got new even better answers beyond what I offered! Overall, a huge win all around.

Friend of the company Dana Robinson recently wrote:

  <p>On a project I'm working on at my current job, I've come across some really pernicious problems where there is either</p>
   
  <ul>
  <li>no good information available or</li>
  <li>the good information is buried under a sea of bad information.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>I've kept these issues in the back of my head and, now that that part of the project is winding down and the issues are resolved, I plan to go on Stack Overflow and create a high-value question and answer pair for each issue.  That way, the next person who has the problem won't have to slog through so much misinformation.  I might even learn some more about the various issues that plagued us if other experts chime in with their own knowledge.</p>

Bottom line -- **never hesitate to ask and answer your own question on any Stack Exchange site.** Please do! It's all part of our shared mission to make the internet better.
