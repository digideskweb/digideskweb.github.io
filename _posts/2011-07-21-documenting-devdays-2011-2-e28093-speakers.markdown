We’re excited to share an in-depth look at just some of the confirmed speakers for [DevDays 2011](http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/)!  The program is comprised of heavy hitters on topics picked by you and the rest of the Stack Overflow community.  As Joel [mentioned](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/devdays-is-back/), the purpose of DevDays is to provide a top-notch education on several technologies and these speakers certainly live up to that challenge.

[London, 14-15 November:](http://devdays.stackoverflow.com/london/)

**Jon Skeet
**Jon Skeet is user 22656 on Stack Overflow, where he tends to post about C# and Java. If you want to attract his attention, post a question pointing out a situation where a C# program doesn’t behave in an expected way, citing the specification. Please don’t do so shortly before this talk though, as he’ll be very distracted until he gets a chance to dig into it.

In terms of coding-for-money, Jon is a software engineer at Google’s London office, currently working on the Google Offers project. He speaks in a personal capacity, however, not on behalf of Google. Except to say that Google is hiring, and any CVs should be sent directly to him.

Intermingled with travelling to various countries around the world, Michael’s 10+ years of experience has been spent battling unnecessary complexity across a variety of industries (finance, telecoms, government) and in whatever technology that happens to have been hurled in his direction (Java/JavaEE, C++, .NET).  Michael is also a sporadic Open Source contributor having dropped patches into a number of OSS projects including PostgreSQL, JBoss, GNU Classpath and most recently Mono.
