Have you noticed the new ads appearing on all of the [Stack Exchange sites](http://stackexchange.com/newsletters)?

That’s right, despite a well-publicized [aversion](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/11/is-email-efail.html) [to](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/09/email-the-variable-reinforcement-machine.html) [email](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/09/when-email-goes-bad.html) [spam](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/04/so-youd-like-to-send-some-email-through-code.html), we’ve added weekly newsletters to all Stack Exchange sites!

The site newsletters are meant for all of those sites that you find interesting but aren’t quite [addicted to](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/56469/what-aspects-of-psychology-does-stack-overflow-take-advantage-of/56797#56797) enough to visit every day.  They include the top **hot questions** for the week, new up-voted **unanswered questions**, and (coming soon!) important **moderator announcements**.  They’re an easy way to catch up on what you might have missed each week.

Of course, these newsletters are strictly opt-in, and you can unsubscribe whenever you want.  You can sign up via the occasional sidebar ad or on your user edit page, or go to [the newsletters page on stackexchange.com](http://stackexchange.com/newsletters) to subscribe to any site.
