You do. I’ll bet like a bazillion [bitcoins](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/) on it.

You’re a human. You’re curious. You don’t know everything. You frequently use [intonation](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/44516/what-is-the-difference-between-inflection-and-intonation/44521#44521) at the end of your thoughts.

Some questions previously brought to [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/):



	
  * Are humans the best marathon runners on earth? [No](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6114/can-trained-humans-run-faster-than-all-other-animals-on-a-marathon-distance/6115#6115).

	
  * Is there a use in the kitchen for salmon heads and spines? [Yes](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/18130/is-there-any-use-to-salmon-heads-and-spines/18152#18152).

	
  * Are pedestrians allowed to use the bike lane? [Maybe](http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/6190/are-runners-allowed-to-use-the-bike-lane/6214#6214).


We are so smart!

By “we,” I mean you, me… humans. Slam a bunch of keyboard characters in celebration!@#$* We nudge friends, ping strangers and query Google when we feel brave enough to fill the itchy vacancies in the libraries of our brains. Asking, I think, might be one of the critical differences between man and the rest of the animal kingdom. Yes, asking and sarcasm and Google.

But how do you prompt a human to ask a question? That’s a problem I’ve wrestled with since joining Stack Exchange in July. How do I remind you that you had that one question while you were drooling into your popcorn while watching that impossibly slow [Terrance Malick movie](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/3698/movies)?

Should I send you a swag bag full of Stack Exchange branded notepads?

It’s hard to remember a question you conceived in the past. It’s much easier, on the other hand, to plug your question into a search field right as the question dawns on you (which is why we need to work on brand awareness at Stack Exchange, not to mention mobile, but that’s a discussion for another time).

Maybe we don’t readily recall what we once wondered because, for the vast majority of human existence, questions were mostly unanswerable. From 12 to 11:59 on the clock of human history, questions did little more than drive cavemen mad. “Why is the moon acting all crazy, yo!”

Today, things are different.
