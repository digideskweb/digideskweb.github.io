As you may have noticed, we’re throwing a party over on [the Gaming site](http://gaming.stackexchange.com).

If you're not a gamer, you may not know that two huge games came out this week: [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](http://www.elderscrolls.com/skyrim) and [Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3](http://www.callofduty.com/mw3).  Game launches are always big for [gaming.stackexchange.com](http://gaming.stackexchange.com) because they're a unique opportunity to get Google search result share before it vanishes into the void of vBulletin and phpBB.  We wanted to throw a big launch party for this year's game release season, but we couldn't agree on which game to pick.





So instead of deciding, we made it a competition: [Skyrim vs. Modern Warfare 3](http://skyrimvsmw3.com).  Each game gets 7 days from when it launches to rack up as many views as it can.  Modern Warfare 3 has been out for 3 days and already racked up an impressive 10,000 views, and is still accelerating going into the weekend.  Skyrim just launched today, but is already starting to make its move.





To make it even more interesting, we're giving away [cool gaming prizes](http://skyrimvsmw3.com/prizes): free games for the top question and answer in each game, and one Grand Prize of a free console or graphics card chosen from everyone who contributed to the winning game (for more details, see [skyrimvsmw3.com/rules](http://skyrimvsmw3.com/rules)).





## Livestream Launch Party





To kick off the weekend, we're throwing a **live party at Stack Exchange HQ in New York**. We'll be live streaming the party and gameplay at [skyrimvsmw3.com](http://skyrimvsmw3.com) starting at **4pm EST**.  You won't want to miss it.  We'll be featuring:






	
  * 10 gaming systems, including 2 projectors

	
  * Live color commentary & interviews by a pair of comedians

	
  * Music, food, and beverages (not included in livestream)




If you're in New York and want to drop by, shoot us an email at [team+gaming@stackexchange.com](mailto:team+gaming@stackexchange.com).  Otherwise, tune into the livestream at [skyrimvsmw3.com](http://skyrimvsmw3.com) starting at 4pm.
