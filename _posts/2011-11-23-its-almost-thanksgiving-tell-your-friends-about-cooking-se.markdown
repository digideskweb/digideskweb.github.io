You're probably really stressed out about making dinner, huh? Have a ton of questions about cooking for large groups, vegetarian substitutes, and that deep frying experiment that went completely wrong? What a perfect time for us to remind you that _we have a site for that... it's called [Seasoned Advice](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/)._

[Reminding people](http://meta.cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/1252/help-promote-this-site-ask-your-thanksgiving-large-group-cooking-questions-h) to turn to Stack Exchange sites at opportune times like this is a really easy way to help promote them. That doesn't necessarily mean waiting around until a holiday - it can be the release of a [new operating system](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/589/now-that-lion-is-out-help-promote-ask-different), a [new video game](http://skyrimvsmw3.com/) coming out, really anything that prompts a lot of questions is a good excuse to say "hey, you know there's this thing called Stack Exchange, right?" Excited about the new Twilight movie? Ask about it on [Sci Fi](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/). New edition of your favorite journal coming out? [Ask about it on one of our academic sites](http://meta.stats.stackexchange.com/questions/1002/upcoming-journal-editions-read-em-and-ask-on-the-stack-and-get-prizes). Need tips on how to work off all that extra stuffing and pumpkin pie you're going to eat tomorrow? Remind your friends that they can ask on [Fitness & Nutrition](http://fitness.stackexchange.com/).

There are times and events that correspond with a lot of our sites, and they are all great excuses to do a little promoting. So when you (or whoever is slaving away in the kitchen tomorrow) has a question about cooking Thanksgiving dinner, remind them that they can ask about it on Stack Exchange!
