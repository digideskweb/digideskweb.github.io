To celebrate the holidays, [Gaming Stack Exchange](http://gaming.stackexchange.com) is throwing a little holiday party -- specifically, a _[Hat Dash](http://hatdash.com)_:

Between December 16 and January 6, users can unlock hats for their gravatars on [gaming.stackexchange.com](http://gaming.stackexchange.com) by asking and answering questions, voting, sharing links, etc.  For more info, read the full blog post:

There's also a related contest around the release of [Star Wars: The Old Republic](http://blog.gaming.stackexchange.com/2011/12/new-hats-for-star-wars-the-old-republic/) with some cool hats _and_ prizes.

**Why Hats?**

Well, once you see it in action you realize that those gravatars are basically begging for cute little hats.  But video games have a long history of vanity items, and a few years ago [Team Fortress 2](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Hats) really brought hats to the forefront.  Since so many Gaming users play Team Fortress 2, hats have become [something](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/35?m=2451253#2451253) [of](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/35?m=44755#44755) [a](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/35?m=284137#284137) [meme](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/2440254#2440254) on the site.

**Why Gaming?**

Gaming has been one of the [top Stack Exchange sites](http://stackexchange.com/sites) in the network for a while, and really [took off](http://www.quantcast.com/gaming.stackexchange.com) a month ago with the release of [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/skyrim).  Since the holidays are traditionally a big time of year for video games, we thought we'd put together a fun little promotion to try to bring in some new questions and users.  And who knows?  If it works well, there's always the possibility of hat-related promotions on other sites (where appropriate!_)_.

**I hate hats**

Then this promotion is not for you!  Just click the "I hate hats" button at the bottom of every page on the Gaming site to make them go away.

**I hate video games**

Well, then... try [one of the other 70+ sites](http://stackexchange.com/sites)!

**I love video games _and_ hats!**

Then come to [gaming.stackexchange.com](http://gaming.stackexchange.com) and ask or answer some questions!  You'll earn your first hat in no time.  But hurry up: after January 6th the site returns to a strict no-hat policy.
