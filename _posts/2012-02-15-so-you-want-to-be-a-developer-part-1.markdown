[A few months ago](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/10/se-podcast-23/) we had [James Portnow](https://twitter.com/#%21/JamesPortnow) of [Extra Credits](http://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/show/extra-credits) on the podcast.  We're huge fans of everything that they're doing over at Extra Credits, so when they asked us to help them write an episode on programming, we jumped at the opportunity.  Here's the link:

If you've never heard of Extra Credits, it's a weekly show about the video game industry from the perspective of people who actually work in it.  It's a fascinating look into game craftsmanship -- not just how video games are made, but what makes them work, what games do well and not so well, and the effects that they have on people.  They talk a lot about about game elements and using them for good and not evil, which is something that we think a lot about with Stack Exchange.

The episode we helped them write is called [So You Want To Be a Developer](http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/so-you-want-to-be-a-developer-part-1).  It's part of a loose series of episodes on the jobs involved in making games and how to be awesome at them.  They've previously done episodes on [game designers](http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/so-you-want-to-be-a-game-designer) and [producers](http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/so-you-want-to-be-a-producer), and wanted to do one on developers but didn't have any direct experience with development.  That's where we came in.

The episode ended up being a two-parter, because apparently we gave them way too much material to fit into one episode.  You can [check out part 1](http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/so-you-want-to-be-a-developer-part-1) now, and come back next week [for part 2](http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/so-you-want-to-be-a-developer-part-2).
