Holy smokes... It's been over three and a half years since Jeff recruited [Valued Associate #00002](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-00002/) to work full-time on building Stack Overflow. In that time, a lot has changed. Jeff's moved on to [teasing us](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/213365532487983105) with his next project, Jarrod's gone from spending his days knee-deep in code to managing the Core dev team and [being big in Japan](https://twitter.com/alexlmiller/status/225382060313935874). And there are now 60 full-time employees of Stack Exchange, many hired from [within the communities](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/eating-our-own-careers-dogfood/) on our sites.

It's been far too many months since [we last introduced](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/01/welcome-valued-associates-anna-rachel-carleejean-and-charles/) any of them, which is a real shame - these folks work hard keeping the lights on, and there's no reason to keep them locked in the basement _all_ the time. So without further ado,


## New Valued Associates

As the new VP of community, Jay will oversee a combined team made up of our existing (and awesome) Chaos and Community teams.  Specifically, he's tasked with driving a 6-sigma confidence level in cloud fluffiness, a 15º improvement in rainbow arc, and a modest 15% lift in unicorn nobility.  He comes from a long, if accidental, career in coal mining financial services, where he started as a two-week temp answering phones, and most recently was a Managing Director of Capital Markets (whatever _that_ means).  Prior to that, he studied Drama at Dartmouth College and did tried to do a lot of crossword puzzles.  Today, he's a proud husband and the father of the world's definitively most-awesome one-year-old [citation needed].
