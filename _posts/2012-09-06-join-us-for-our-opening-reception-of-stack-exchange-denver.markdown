[In case you couldn't tell](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/08/stack-exchange-takes-on-denver-welcome-to-our-new-colleagues/), we’re [very](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stackexchange/7776308984/in/set-72157631181635072) [excited](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stackexchange/7776308010/in/set-72157631181635072) about our new office opening in Denver. And though it’s very tempting to just relax on our new [roof deck](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stackexchange/7776299606/in/set-72157631181635072) or over a game of [pool](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stackexchange/7833569654/in/set-72157631181635072), we think something this big calls for an even bigger bash.

**And we’d like you to be there.**

Stack Exchange _is_ you, the dedicated and brilliant folk who've worked to build these sites for the past four years. You've made [this miracle](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/09/then-a-miracle-occurs-public-beta/) happen, and if you’re in (or can get to) the greater Denver area, we’d love to meet you face to face.

**But wait, there's more!** Stop by and get…



	
  * A tour of our Stack Exchange Denver hub—roof deck included!

	
  * Snacks and delicious treats from our favorite Denver caterer

	
  * Free drinks and Stack Exchange swag

	
  * A chance to meet Joel Spolsky and some of our devs and sales reps


We're planning this shindig for the evening of September 27th, so [**RSVP today**](http://s.tk/denver).

We hope to see you there!
