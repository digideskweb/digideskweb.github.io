The Mile High City was buzzing last week as it hosted its first ever [Denver Startup Week](http://denverstartupweek.com/). With more than 80 events hosted by startups all around the city, the week attracted hundreds of entrepreneurs from the Colorado area. Since our Denver office just opened in August, this was a perfect time for us to get to know some of our new neighbors a little better.

**Startup Job Fair**

On Tuesday, October 23, after our quick spot on [Channel 9 News](http://www.9news.com/money/295707/344/QA-company-now-hiring-in-Denver), we set up shop at the Startup Job Fair to recruit even more awesome talent to our company. After two hours, we brought in nearly 50 resumes—thanks to everyone who showed up! In case you couldn’t make it, it’s still not too late to apply! [Check out our job openings here](http://stackexchange.com/about/hiring).

**Denver Startup Crawl**

More than 20 companies participated in a Startup Crawl that led registrants all around Denver to check out the great office spaces and have a beverage or two. Despite the freezing rain/snow, we hosted more than 40 attendees at our Stack Exchange Denver HQ—and our warm, spiked apple cider was a big hit. If you didn’t make it this time, keep your eyes peeled for our next event… though we can’t promise we’ll have bacon apple whiskey tartlets like this again.

**Class: How to Hire Developers in a Competitive Market
**

Thursday boasted our biggest event of all—more than 50 of you joined us in our office to learn how to hire programmers in this tough market. [Guy Zerega](http://stackexchange.com/users/383041/guyzee) (National Sales Manager) and [Korneel Bouman](http://stackexchange.com/users/77247/korneel-bouman) (Director of Customer Support and Sales Operations) flew out from our New York hub to offer up tips on tech recruitment and writing good developer job listings. Complete with brunch (not to mention a full Bloody Mary and mimosa bar), we hope this class helped a few of your with your own recruitment needs. You can [sign up for our watchlist](http://www.skillshare.com/How-to-Hire-Developers-in-a-Competitive-Market/5414387) for future classes here.
