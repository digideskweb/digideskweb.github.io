[When we launched Careers 2.0 back in 2011](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/careers-2-0-launches/), we set out with a goal: make the job search process better for the millions of programmers who visit our site every month. Part of achieving this goal is educating employers about what _you_ want from them. In the past, our [annual user survey](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/01/2012-stack-overflow-user-survey-results/) helped us help companies change the way they found and hired programmers, while [Joel’s book on how to find the best technical talent](http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Gets-Things-Done-Technical/dp/1590598385) and his talk on [how to stand out and attract top talent](http://www.ereexpo.com/2012spring/speakers/3993/) are a few other examples of how we've worked to educate tech companies on what you really want. 

Today, we’re taking this one step further:

Employers are having a really hard time getting programmers to work for them -- hardly a day goes by without another article, blog post or Tweet attesting to this. A study last year found that as many as [93% of employers](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/13/it-skills-gap-study_n_1341385.html) find a disparity between the technical skills required and the level of the talent they’re able to find while recruiting. As a result, talented programmers are in incredibly high demand, putting you in a position to demand the best jobs, perks, and benefits. 

In the [Employer Resource Center](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/resources), we offer advice on best practices, recruitment news and trends, case studies and product guides to help employers with developer hiring. We’ll be updating the content regularly (mostly via the new [Careers 2.0 blog](http://blog.careers.stackoverflow.com/)), so check back often! If you have any tips you think employers should know about hiring developers, please leave a note in the comments below.
