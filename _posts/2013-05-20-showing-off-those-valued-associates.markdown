Stack Overflow has always had a strong focus on _individual_ merit. Although collaboration is encouraged to some extent by the editing features, attribution on posts and the design of user profiles all tend to emphasize rugged individuality, that lone wolf toiling away at a keyboard.

But most of us don't actually _work_ that way. We're social creatures by nature, and the most challenging part of finding a good job can be finding the pack you want to run with. In spite of the dearth of features aimed at networking, folks have been using Stack Overflow to find and research potential colleagues almost since the day it launched - so a couple years ago, [we started looking for ways to make this a bit easier](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/80834/need-feedback-on-company-page-idea). Well, [now it's done](http://blog.careers.stackoverflow.com/2013/05/17/introducing-careers-2-0-company-pages/):



<blockquote>With Company Pages, we’ve focused on the best ways to tell an interesting company story. And what better way to tell your story than with massive photos of workstations, team outings, hackathons, local attractions, and the people who make the companies who they are? There are tightly designed sections to list your company tech stack and benefits, along with plenty of room to be creative and communicate what makes your company special, what awesome products you’re working on, and the philosophy that drives your team forward.
