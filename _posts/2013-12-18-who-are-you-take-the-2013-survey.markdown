Hi folks, just a quick note here to remind y'all that [the yearly Stack Overflow User Survey is live!](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/9KPHP7H)

We've edited the questions/answers based on your feedback from [last year's survey](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/01/2012-stack-overflow-user-survey-results/) and suggestions [posted on Meta](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/209790/suggest-a-question-for-the-2013-stack-overflow-user-survey).

As a small token of our appreciation, we'll be donating $1 for each completed survey to your choice of one of this year's [Stack Exchange Gives Back](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/12/stack-exchange-gives-back-2013-2/) charities (on top of what we're already donating on behalf of each site).

As always, we'll be posting the results here on the blog once the survey is completed.

**[Take the survey!](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/9KPHP7H)**
