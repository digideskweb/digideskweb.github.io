Earlier this year, we announced the release of our [Android application](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/01/stack-exchange-for-android-is-here/) and the public feedback was fantastic. Well, it turns out we offended our designers by not doing an iPhone application too. So, after spending the last few months apologizing and bribing them (turns out designers love moleskins in pantone colors), we're excited to announce the release of Stack Exchange for your iPhone.

Feed Me, Seymour




At the heart of our mobile applications is **The Feed** which gives you a deeply personalized selection of content customized to what’s relevant to you.




It includes any new answers, comments, or upvotes on your posts, and even new questions we think you’d like based on your previous activity. It basically does all the hard work to make it so you always have something interesting waiting for you a tap on a blue icon away. Since it's personalized, try not to judge me based on how nerdy the following sample is:

## Real time feedback




Stack Exchange for iPhone sends you instant notifications any time someone interacts with you, so when you urgently need to figure out how long cooked chicken lasts in the fridge (turns out, a couple days) you’ll get a notification the second someone answers your question.

And you can always customize the notifications in your iPhone's built in Settings, in case you don't want to get a message in the middle of the night (and end up dreaming of chicken).


## Like Stack Exchange on your computer, but better.




You can ask, answer, comment, and vote, and there's even a built-in Markdown keyboard. Plus, you can upload images straight from your device.

The next time [you want to identify a cool font you see on a poster](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2014/04/podcast-57-we-just-saw-this-on-florp/), you can immediately post a question with a picture of it from your iPhone.


## What about feature [...]?


While the application currently has some awesome features, it doesn't have everything. If you find something wrong or missing, please let us know. Use your fancy new app to post a question on [Meta using the ios-app tag](http://meta.stackexchange.com/tags/ios-app).


There are already [some great suggestions](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios-app+feature-request+-status-completed?sort=votes), and while we’re currently working on a dedicated tablet interface for both iPads and Android, the urgency of our iPhone improvements will be pretty closely related to the vote count of posts on meta.




Speaking of which, we'd like to give a huge thanks to the awesome people who answered our call to arms (well, thumbs) to test this application, and who provided us with great feedback (including the list of suggestions above).




So, what are you waiting for? Go download Stack Exchange on your iPhone now and you’ll  never have to wait until you get back home to [figure out “What was that movie with the guy and that thing?” again](http://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/identify-this-movie)!
