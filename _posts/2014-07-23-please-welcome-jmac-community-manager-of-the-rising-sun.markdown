As Stack Exchange continues to expand to serve new audiences, we're constantly on the lookout for folks who can take the principles and practices we all hold dear and communicate them effectively to the folks who would otherwise find them strange and difficult. I'm happy to announce we've found another of these rare specimens in the form of [**Joshua Maciel**](http://workplace.stackexchange.com/users/7945/jmac):

Josh joins us remotely from beautiful Kansai Japan, where youthful ignorance brought him for a two-year stay (maximum!) to teach English. Eleven years later he still hasn’t left, having found gainful employment doing international sales for Japanese manufacturers, along with something he refers to as a ‘social life’ in Western Japan.

After living extensively in two cultures, and working in a half-dozen more, Josh decided that humans are really interesting, despite all their peccadilloes. And what better way to study these humans in their natural habitat than by participating on Stack Exchange! 

Josh first caught our attention on Meta, gaining the admiration and respect of us all by politely pointing out how [incredibly wrong](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/211080/improving-demonstrate-a-minimal-understanding-close-reason/215220#215220) and [delusional](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/219922/what-is-the-goal-of-hot-network-questions/220099#comment719219_220099) most of my opinions are. After a few months of respectable participation on Stack Overflow, he joined [our site for questions about workplace](http://workplace.stackexchange.com/) and career-related issues and proved me wrong once again by helping the good folk there to push that site out of the beta doldrums and into graduation. He then proceeded to get himself [elected as a moderator](http://workplace.stackexchange.com/election/1), where he continued to demonstrate the sort of dedication and tact that has been his hallmark. 

Josh can usually be found in his natural habitats: at a baseball game somewhere in the world, sitting with a book in Ubud, or finding a local watering hole to escape the Japanese summer heat. Please join me in toasting to his health as he takes on this new challenge.
