It is not actually about stack overflows it is about a place dedicated to finding help on general programming issues and is not language specific.\n2.  I also tend to think of a beaker filled with something overflowing.\n\nWith that I would suggest these ideas:\n\nA logo with either a beaker spewing ones and zeros (I saw something similar but it was more of a test tube)\n\nSomething spitting out some random non-specific code snippets with multiple colors making it seem like a welcome place (well the color scheme could be anything really)\n\nYou should really try for a logo that represents what the site is all about, on my glance through I did not really see anything fitting that at all.\n\nCodingHorror has a perfect logo for what the blog was initially intended for, that may be why I was initally attracted to it.  I was looking for something that will help me as a young programmer looking to learn more about the issues professionals face and what to avoid.  The logo definitely fits as it appears your goal is for those reading to try to avoid writing code that would cause that face."}, {"author_name": "Juan", "gravatar_hash": "0e082774401a8f7760c401e06925699c", "author_url": "http://www.juanformoso.com.ar", "date": "Apr 29, 2008", "message": "I love the last one (as of now, of course)\n\n#269"}, {"author_name": "Patrick", "gravatar_hash": "a0ebd390adb6c11f64f12c6898447031", "author_url": "http://LozziSolutions.com", "date": "Apr 29, 2008", "message": "Great designs thus far folks!
