A computer engineer grad can take some tests and become certified as a Professional Engineer which confers additional responsibility.  In the software world this responsibility is largely wasted but may one day be required for certain high-risk projects such as safety-critical systems.\n\nComputer science is about the fundamentals of technology, such as recursion vs iteration, performance, etc.  Software Engineering is about engineering: risk management and mitigation, and how to guarantee success in a project.\n\nAs for the rest of the Computer Engineering curriculum it differs from Computer Science in that there is a broader focus on hardware and building things and working in teams, whereas the computer science curriculum is structured differently and has fewer required courses.

Here is a good example: \n\nSay you have a page that's made up from user controls that are loaded dynamically based off of multiple templates stored in a database or a config file. Say another requirement is that these controls need to be able to persist their state for later on down the road (perhaps weeks later). This being the case, the user controls implement an IPersistable interface. To add another knot, say each control may or may-or-may-not be a composite of other controls including other IPersistable controls.\n\nWhen the user is done doing their business, we want to call the IPersistable.Save() method on all of the controls that support it on the page. Since the page is made up dynamically, the developer cannot deterministically single out which controls to save so the developer has find these controls. However, the .NET Page.Controls.FindControl(...) method only allows you to traverse one level deep. Therefore a good way to make sure you persist every control on the page that can be persisted is to create a recursive function that takes a control as the argument. If that control is IPersistable, then it calls the Save() method. Then, either way the if statement went, the method calls itself for each control in that control's.Controls collection. Since Page is a Control, you can use the Page as the argument when you initially call the function, and you'll end up recursively calling the function on every control in the page."}, {"author_name": "alto malt\u00e9s", "gravatar_hash": "49653b4d686c57ff6c68dc19f709356f", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 30, 2008", "message": "Computer scientist, software engineer, electrical engineer, \u2026 whatever \u2014 who cares about names?
