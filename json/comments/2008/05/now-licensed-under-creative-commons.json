I believe the CC licensing is for the podcasts only.  I think the baic idea is that if you could code faster then Jeff, in theory you could launch StackOverflow2.com and steal all of their ideas.\n\nNow if you listened to their podcast and decided to create some new audio mixing tool based on the troubles they have had I think you're safe.\n\nAs for code on the site that's a different animal.  I would imagine the bulk of the code on the site is going to be code samples and not fully functioning apps posted to the web.\n\nJust like ExEx, MSDN Forums and other sites where users contribute code - most of it is (a)  not worth copyrighting or (b) demonstrating a sample of how to do a relatively simple task in code.

Often that permission is in the form of some license (GPL, BSD, etc.).  Now that I see what is covered by the CC license here, I'm just hoping any sample project, controls, code, or otherwise useful bits from the site don't have the SAME license applied to them.\n\nAgain, Sorry for overreacting. :)"}, {"author_name": "tqjustc", "gravatar_hash": "6b0d2577dfb7d3bcea0dc6f3b4133339", "author_url": null, "date": "Jan 17, 2013", "message": "Recently, I work on stack overflow dump.
