One major problem with virtual goods is, that as soon as the \"customer\" pays, the item is out on the way to him. On the one side that's good, but the downside is, that fraudsters using stolen creditcards get the stolen good at once without the chance of having human intervention.\n\nWe once had one of those bad customers and we knew that something's terribly wrong about him (a.k.a.: We were absolutely sure with no doubt possible). What did we do? He used an yahoo.com email address and he had changed the password that was assigned to him from our system to something different. So evil us took that information and tried to log on to his yahoo mail account with the same password that he used on our site.\n\nTo sum it up: it worked, we found out who he was stealing the money from (based on the emails in his account) and were able to warn them. They all had done fake ebay transactions. We even got his contact details. Let's just say, he was quite baffled when we called him on his mobile.\n\nAnd what do we learn?

However, I believe that he got it all wrong. I'm studying bioinformatics, and a good part of the studies, and the reason why we do the job better than either a biologist or a programmer or even a team consisting of both, is that we have knowledge in both domains. Other people, whatever their background,now working in this domain envy us for our knowledge (although there's also a good dose of scorn involved, because obviously we poor inbetweeners know only parts of everything and everything of nothing). Actually, the example involving the pH of cells and laser scanning microscopy is a good one. At face value, knowledge of the underlying mechanism might not seem necessary but I can imagine a lot of situations where that might pose a problem. (Have they thought of photobleaching? Is time a factor? Do cell compartments move? How to correctly choose the image plane?) At the very least, the programmer has to rely on someone else telling him everything he has to consider, and even then a communication problem might (will!) ensue.\n\nOn the other hand it's true that most domain-specific software that I know (mostly, that's medical and biological research software) is poorly written and the user interfaces would make even the author of GUI Bloopers cry in despair.

If you move a window near an edge it doesn't snap/jump, but once you've got it flush to an edge it \"sticks\" there a little bit until you move far enough. It's hard to describe, but Ubuntu has it (and thus it's probably a GNOME feature I guess).\n\nIt's less annoying than snap-to-edge which pulls the window from your grasp if you happen to move a window near an edge while moving a window, but it makes it very easy to line things up if you want to."}, {"author_name": "Andrew", "gravatar_hash": "eb1e658170ecdcbb831507c8163cbd87", "author_url": "http://www.andrewdothay.net", "date": "May 30, 2008", "message": "Hi Guys,\n\nRegarding password management we use today (until something better gains broad support), I use a similar program as Joel.

I hope you find any of them useful.\n\nRegards\nPaulo\n\n- Initially I understood the podcast (and associated site) as a language agnostic place. Sure that specific problems will be approached, and specific problems concern specific technologies. But my understanding was that there was room for every technology (language, operating system, architecture, etc). A place where we all can share experiences and challenges, and where we all can learn with each other. But there were a couple of episodes where I felt that some pejorative comments were made about Java (and implicitly about whoever decides to use it). Maybe I understood it wrongly, but I felt like a second-class citizen because I was using Java. I guess that the authors are closer to the Microsoft technologies, but should not people who think differently be welcome as well (without judgments about who made the better choice)?\n- I listen to many technology podcasts, and this complain goes to every single one of them. I work mostly in the back-end, and a significant part of the developers out there are working in the back-end as well. Nevertheless the front-end gets most of the attention. I keep listening a million stories about how to create a web interface in every possible technology, how to create desktop applications, how to create user interfaces that are portable across different devices, etc etc etc. But matters like data persistence, transaction management, performance tunning, messaging, etc. are very seldom mentioned. I would love to be able to exchange info with other people and to learn a bit more about what is being done in other places in terms of back-end. How are the .Net guys managing transactions across different resources? How can I interact with a messaging system using Phyton? What kind of thread management capabilities are offered by Ruby?\n- Could there be a section for sharing patterns (this applies more to the site than to the podcast)?\nSomething like the guys from TheServerSide (www.theserverside.com/patterns) have. I find it extremely useful, and I learn a lot with it. I feel that the StackOverflow would be a natural place for sharing such kind of information.\n- Besides sharing experiences just about coding, can you discuss a bit about related matters? For example, what database will you use for the StackOverflow? And why? What about version controlling system? What degree of project automation do you have? Do you model it using UML? If yes, what tool do you use? I guess I made my point :-)"}, {"author_name": "lisa", "gravatar_hash": "701e61880fecc74b84f905458de23811", "author_url": null, "date": "Jun 02, 2008", "message": "Hi I've only caught up the podcast #5 and in that you mentioned personal app use tracking software (so you can see how long you spend on Reddit, Outlook, etc, per day).

I feel that Jeff was slightly off base by paying almost too much attention to soft skills.  Developers should take charge of their career, and this equates to either being a key member on a huge open source project or improving soft skills and becoming a leader.  I've interviewed developers with amazing soft skills but no real teeth. This is why Joel wins the \"learn C\" debate!  When developers don't understand, or don't have the ability to understand the deep structures of a language or platform their solutions are always cheapened.  Maybe fragile?  \nBasically, what I'm trying to say is, technology has not solved all our problems.  Faster processors have not solved the fact that multi-threaded, parallel code is still difficult and not being done well.

Also, if a user is presented with a redirect to an openId provider then they are quite likely to go somewhere else. Its another thing to manage and remember\n\nOn the other hand, if companies like google/yahoo/MS implemented openId systems, then we could just provide an email address as an openid username, from which the openid url could be determined (based on the domain). User would not be confused, not have to worry about which provider to use as they could use someone they already trust (all they know is that their email is required)\n\nFrom a users point of view, they would then provide just an email address, enter their password, and bingo everything would be filled out.\n\nBrowsers could also have inbuilt openId management plugins, which would recognize when a site uses openId, automatically retrieve user details from the users preferred provider (based on users email), then pre populate forms, or in the case of login, give the requesting site a one time url to grab the user login details from the openid provider (so there is some background talking between browser plugin and openId provider on the users behalf). This would solve the problem of storing passwords on USBs, keeping details in sync amongst multiple computers, ensuring all sites have access to your latest correct details, and also ensuring sites don't have access to your password. Plugin could even distribute and sync info amongst a couple of openId providers to ensure that if one goes down, there is not a single point of failure (automatically falling back to another provider if it down when logging user into a site).\n\nThe problems attempting to be solved are:\n\n1. keeping user details up to date amongst multiple sites\n2. keeping track of logins across multiple sites\n3. keeping track of passwords across multiple computers\n4. not having to renter user details for every site user signs up to\n5. ensure user is not tied to a single openId provider if they are down, go out of business\n\nI think a combination of using a browser plugin and multiple openId providers solves all the above issues"}, {"author_name": "CStick", "gravatar_hash": "a9e35a190d6b5395ac07e9b6a085a7ad", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 10, 2008", "message": "The WinSplit Revolution link doesn't seem to work any longer.
