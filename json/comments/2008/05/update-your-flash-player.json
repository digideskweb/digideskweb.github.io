I think the defaults in Audacity gave me the problem.  Don't remember if this is the page that got me fixed but it looks like it has everything:\n\"The problem is that Flash Player only supports two sampling rates: 22,050 samples per second, and 44,100 samples per second. And at low bitrates, Audacity likes to create MP3 files with lots of different sampling rates, such as 16,000 or 32,000 samples per second.\n\nSo, what's the solution? Currently the best fix is to convert your audio files to MP3s manually, using the command line version of the LAME MP3 encoder.\"\n\nhttp://www.boutell.com/newfaq/creating/chipmunk.html"}, {"author_name": "Brad", "gravatar_hash": "a733ce6210c28924181fadd757810335", "author_url": null, "date": "May 20, 2008", "message": "Jeff, take a look at http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject/ \n\nIt allows you to specify a minimum compatible flash version and handles all of the \"update your flash player\" stuff for you.

At work, we regularly deliver audio in Flash and when we switched to a lower bitrate, we had \"chipmunk\" sounds.\n\nIn our case, it turned out that there are a number of common pro audio editors that will default to non-compatible sampling rates when you get into bitrates &lt; 64 Kbps. So the files that we were getting from the sound engineers were playing funny.\n\nRunning them through LAME or Sorenson Squeeze (which is meant for video but will batch encode for MP3, etc.) fixed the problem."}]}
