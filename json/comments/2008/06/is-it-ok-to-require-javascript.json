Although \"JS-Off\" is a nice shorthand for the situation, it implies a preference setting when this is rarely the case. \"JS-Off\" really should be though of as \"JS active,\" and there are many cases where JS may be available or on, but your code will not run. Causes I'm familiar with:\n\n1- Tech-heads turn it off because they want something more \"pure.\" (This is what most people think of when they think \"JS-Off\")\n2- Corporate, government, and military firewalls run by said tech-heads filter out external JS files. They do this not maliciously or out of their own purist attitude, but because the management paid for a million dollar intranet app essential to business, and it only runs on IE6 -- and the app breaks if IE6 is modified, patched, or uninstalled, so it must be shielded vigilantly. (Estimate likelihood by asking yourself what forces would cause 40% of your traffic to still run IE6 in this day and age -- it's not lethargy, when the easiest thing to do was to let the auto-upgrade take place last year.)\n3- A JS error, perhaps delivered via ad code and out of your control, causes the JS engine to shut down on your page (and most people will not see an error message). If the JS shutdown happens without their knowledge, and they happily spent 30 minutes composing some \"participation,\" only to have it disappear when they submit it, you've been an ungrateful host.\n4- A JS error, perhaps caused by your code interacting with some crazy Unicode character or XSS technique you never tested against, causes the JS engine to shut down temporarily. See #3.\n5- The future is unknown. In 1998 I was monintoring how much of my company's traffic was JS-Off, when a security hole in IE4 caused Microsoft to recommend turning off JS. Within two months we went from 5% JS-Off, to over 40% of our visitors with JS-Off. Our JS-On competitor folded shop, and we increased our traffic -- maybe from our competitor's audience.\n6- In 1998, JS-On was risky; after a period of low risk (2000-2005, after which JS-Off cell phones started to take off), it is becoming risky again -- and this is due to positive pressure. It's a Good Thing, and unlikely to go away. Cell phone and other non-PC browsers are becoming JS-compatible at the same time we're seeing explosive growth in non-browser uses of the web. Apple's Dictionary is not JS-capable, but pulls from Wikipedia; Safari and IE8 allow \"web clips\", where users can crop out a portion of your page and view it outside of the regular browser environment (in these cases, still rendered by the browser engines, but not necessarily the JS-engine); RSS and other news readers specifically do not run JS, but they are now incorporating other data scraped from well-formed markup on web pages. In a forward-thinking architecture, you can't be certain what environment your markup arrives in.\n\nOnly one of these six cases represents an audience that actively chose to turn off JS, and can turn it back on. The other five audiences with JS-Off do not even know it -- they just know your site doesn't work. The result of all of this is that you may assume that JS is active, and in turn you will find that you are right -- because your site will act as a passive filter reducing the participation of those who do not conform.\n\nYou are a pro, and you know a lot about this field, but no matter how much you know now it is safe to say that you will learn more about this particular project in the future than you have in the past. By assuming JS-On, you are stating that what you already know is more important than what you don't yet know. Progressive enhancement, by assuming JS-Off (among other things), means that you will always be able to build up (or down) to whatever the future has in store.\n\niPhone multi-touch events, anyone?"}, {"author_name": "Trance Diviner", "gravatar_hash": "1654cc357241e9135c6baac21b1b465c", "author_url": null, "date": "Jun 09, 2008", "message": "The web is no longer HTML.

To me it's obvious what you should do, because it's part of best practice web development.\n\n1. Use Javascript as much as you need to to make the user experience slicker, more enjoyable or more productive; WYSIWYG editing, syntax highlighting or side by side preview when editing a post are all good examples of things that will make life better for the users of stackoverflow. \n\n2. Do it using best-practice techniques ie unobtrusive. Make sure the basic form or page will work without JS on, and then run scripts on window.onload to enhance the user experience. This is easy and should not make things take longer. You need to do all validation again on the server anyway for security.\n\nThere should be no need to tell the user JS is off if it's off; most things can just work the normal way.\n\n3. Ensure good basic accessibility: use HTML as intended, paying good attention to structure of headings, lists and paragraph tags; ensure the source order is sensible whether tables or CSS is used for layout; ensure alt text is correct on all images; and use form labels properly. Using JavaScript correctly does not make the site inaccessible to people with disabilities at all; omitting the above things does. \n\nIt's ridiculous to conflate JavaScript and accessibility legislation; JS is a core browser technology and using it does not discriminate against someone on grounds of their disability. Requiring sight or use of a mouse does, by contrast.\n\nI will certainly be using stackoverflow from mobile clients; I work on a laptop on the train two hours a day; because of patchy coverage, a tethered mobile modem doesn't work well and BlackBerry or iPhone give much better access to web resources in that situation.\n\nI can't help feeling that some of the views above are from the last century. JavaScript is a core web technology and worrying about whether or not to use it on a web site is like worrying about whether we should try to avoid breathing nitrogen.\n\nIt's like the couple of comments against Flash - what is better than Flash for serving high-quality video to the largest possible audience?

Thus, you have to choose between making the non-JS version user-friendly or live with the fact, that it will work w/o JS, but maybe not as nice as it could be.\n\nThus, for more complex situations you will have to spend more money and time to create comfortable non-JS solutions.
