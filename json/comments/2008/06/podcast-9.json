Now, I'm just one guy with an opinion, so this isn't a flame, but ...\n\nThe thing about passwordmaker.org is, if you use their online widgit to reconstruct a password for, say ... yourbank.com, you're doing the same thing you'd be doing at passwordsafe.com (which passwordmaker sort of sneers at in their intro, and rightfully so). You're giving your password and the yourbank.com pieces of information to some stranger on the internet. Now, both passwordsafe and passwordmaker will say they're secure, and that their operators have no personal access to your passwords - but how can you be sure? Has either of them passed independent audit by anyone you really trust? Will either site assume any liability if they do manage to leak your passwords?\n\nDon't get me wrong here. I'm fairly sure that both passwordsafe and passwordmaker originate from the purveyors' sincere desire to provide safe and secure ways of keeping our password messes in order. But never underestimate the possibility for good intentions to generate bad results sooner or later.\n\nFor me, either option is too scary. I use eWallet, ( http://www.iliumsoft.com/site/ew/ewallet.php ), which I can sync to my PC and my smartphone. I suppose it's still possible that eWallet could somehow send my passwords back to their maker, but at least now I could check and/or stop this, by having a client-side firewall which prohibits the program from ever phoning home.\n\nI'm going to carry my phone anyway, so now I have a password repository that's backed up, and goes with me wherever I go. It's handy. Not ideal (I agree about OpenID, Jeff) ... but handy given the current state of the game.\n\nAnyway. Just my 2 cents.

Say, I created an account at cingular.com, and now it's wireless.att.com (okay, this is a pretty obvious name change, but sometimes, you may not remember the name of the old site). Also, since all sites seem to have different password rules (some allow one set of characters, others allow another set of characters), how should I keep track of which site uses which character set? And how do you keep track of other rules (password length, etc)? I don't use PasswordMaker, but if others do, I wonder how they handle these issues. It just seems no less hassle to me than the original problem. Personally, I can't wait when Clipperz implements tagging and grouping, and I can outsource my password storage to it. At this point, the best option is to use a password manager program (I prefer KeePass) and either sync files (e.g. via FolderShare if you can access it from behind the corporate firewall), or store the encrypted passwords file online at location which can be mapped as a drive (share), such as GSpace or who.hasfiles.com (the latter allows you to map a drive to a personal online storage area; connection is done over HTTP, but for a small fee you can get HTTPS support if you really care). If someone has a better approach, I would also really like to know. Thanks for raising this issue.\n\nP.S. Nice podcast. I did not care much for the first couple of podcasts, but they seem to get better and better lately. Please keep it up."}, {"author_name": "Nicholas Bieber", "gravatar_hash": "cb9e249283eea099f5cc5a3e48fe04f4", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 21, 2008", "message": "&gt;Young system consultants trying to do everything\n\n... oh my god!  that's me!
