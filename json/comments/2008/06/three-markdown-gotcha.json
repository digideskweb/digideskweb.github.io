A short list of features Markup lacks:\n\n* Tables. Useful for anything from truth tables to descriptions of allowed parameters. Without these built-in, the likely workaround is fragile ASCII-art in &lt;pre&gt; tags.\n\n* Definition lists. Often used for describing new programming terms, or for documenting function parameters. Can probably be simulated using an unordered list, but that is annoying to type and style.\n\n* Citations. If I want to link to a journal to back up a point, it's nice to have built-in support without having to jerry-rig them using inline links and anchor IDs.\n\n* Section links.
