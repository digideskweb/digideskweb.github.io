You don't even need to store a timezone for each user in the database either.\n\nHere's how I worked it out, on my site. Create a cookie on the user's computer, storing the offset in minutes between the user's timezone and GMT 00:00. (I did this with javascript). Then, using a server-side language (PHP in my case), I found out the offset between the server and GMT 00:00 (using date('Z'); ) and then I worked out the difference between the two. Then when I want to display a date (absolute dates in this case), I just subtract the total offset (i.e. server-client) from the timestamp that I just retrieved from the database.\n\nAlso, you might ask, what if javascript is turned off? Well basically, time is display in GMT 00:00 then.. I personally prefer it that way (i.e. in the case when javascript is disabled) than displaying time in the server's timezone.. because if the server is in, let's say in the west coast of USA, users from europe/asia will be \"disadvantaged\" because there's a major shift in the timezone, but if it's displayed in GMT 00:00 it's \"even\" for every user..
