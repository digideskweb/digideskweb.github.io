I want to suggest, 'Purely Functional Data Structures'. It's my current read and gives a great insight on minimizing space/time in an immutable world. I'm currently working with a functional language (ocaml), and doing scientific software, so I might be a bit different then the norm (?)."}, {"author_name": "Chris Hudson", "gravatar_hash": "a4040b3cd8ee723e93f1c95ddeb0b5bc", "author_url": "http://www.xetius.com", "date": "Jul 11, 2008", "message": "Jeff, you mentioned in passing something about the undo functionality and going back to previous versions (in conjunction with the early talk about Subversion and offlinedness).
