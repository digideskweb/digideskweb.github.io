I'd like to offer a situation in which I felt strongly that I needed two function/block arguments.\n\nConsider a typical database query which selects some columns from some table or combination of tables resulting in an arbitrary number of rows. During such database access from an OO language, there are typically two code chunks which vary according to the purpose of the database access. \n\nThe first chunk is to convert the input values to the appropriate SQL (either by supplying parameters to a pre-compiled SQL statement with placeholders, or by building some literal SQL as a string.\n\nThe second chunk is to process each returned row of data. This may involve creating or populating some row object, directly calling out to some business logic  in a \"streaming\" manner, or whatever.\n\nIn the low-level database access tools I typically use from Java, each of these two steps can be provided as a \"functor\". This allows the basic database access code (connection opening, error handling, connection closing, etc.) to be completely generic.\n\nWhen I first experimented with Ruby I found the popular way of accessing databases (ActiveRecord) limiting in that it did not really support arbitrary queries or streamed result processing, so I considered porting the ideas from the Java implementation.\n\nI immediately bumped into the \"only one block\" limitation, as I needed tow bloks. For this and several other reasons, I am now spending most of my learn-a-new-language time on Python."}, {"author_name": "Yuval", "gravatar_hash": "16f92030c77f97528ba957faa8a6dc53", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 13, 2008", "message": "Just a quick note about the Israeli IT market...\n\nI'm an Israeli Java programmer, and I can attest to the fact that there is in fact, as Joel said, a very dynamic spirit of entrepreneurship and the number of start-up companies in Israel is far from proportional to the number of IT working force here. These companies usually hire programmers directly, and because starting a new company is somewhat risky and demanding, programmers in start-up companies are usually highly compensated.\n\nThen again, most large IT companies (Amdocs, Comverse, Microsoft, Intel, HP...) have R&amp;D centers here, and they need masses of programmers. These are usually programmers with less experience or not enough technical background, and they work less hours for less money.\n\nThese programmers are sometimes hired directly, but the large companies usually prefer to take on armies of outsourcing workers, mostly for budget reasons, but also because it's convenient. Of course, off-shoring is also a popular option, but Israeli workers are still preferred.\n\nThe point is that while there is a strong initiative spirit in Israel, it isn't that different than the rest of the world in that a great deal of programmers still work through outsourcing companies.\n\nHaving said this, I'll say that outsourcing is not always that bad... when projects are short-term, one can meet a lot of interesting people, be exposed to a wide variety of technologies, and learn from the mistakes of many other programmers. It can serve as a good stepping stone in a programmer's career."}, {"author_name": "iHeartDucks", "gravatar_hash": "28772e8dc1742bbab62b7c36398cd369", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 29, 2009", "message": "Disappointed with Wall-E!!!!
