I dunno, its cool, but its about as interesting as forum badges that are based on the number of posts. But not anything wrong with it either.\n\nHowever, I don't think it re-captures the \"Xbox 360\" badge system. Xbox 360 is about gaming, not answering programming questions. So you get to be \"spam cop\" if you mark 3 items as \"spam,\" I'm not sure people would go after that for the badges the same as they would go after the \"Eagle Eye\" (or whatever) badge in Tiger Woods 2008. And if they do, it seems like they would just mark random messages as spam to get the badge; or stick specific business logic for each particular badge.\n\nAnother thing, what is the big deal about anonymous posting? The whole cookie thing seems kind of clunky. Most programmers have more than one machine and will create a new account anyway. It seems like a lot of fuss for a \"friction free\" system. \n\nLook at the top forums on the Net; they have thousands of users contributing and they all had to sign up. Make the sign-up easy, don't bother with anonymous posting. And the idea that \"Well, we use Open ID and Open ID is a mammoth to sign up for, so we will have anonymous posting\" is not a great answer.\"\n\nNow, as far as the slippage of the deadline. Its no big deal, not talking about a lot of time here. Though, to be honest Jeff, whether you like or not, you, by virtue of having an ultra popular tech blog that you get paid to write, as well as your writing style (whether its some silly feigned \"Smackdown Learning\" thing or not) do act as some authority in software development circles. Therefore, your arguments to Joel about why you don't have a list are pretty silly! Something about \"Joel was a not taker in college and I'm not a note taker\" ... that's just totally ridiculous! Is the idea that \"Writing specs down while developing is for those note-taker people\" one of those Weak Ideas Weakly held? :)"}, {"author_name": "Grom", "gravatar_hash": "a14537020ec5b11fea3b956353724860", "author_url": "http://grom.zeminvaders.net", "date": "Aug 06, 2008", "message": "I am so hoping Joel talks about C in the next podcast.
