Jeff/Joel, I hope you read this and seriously consider this before you continue with your site design.  You don't have to agree with me, of course, but please think about the direction you are going here.\n\nThe site looks fine, in the sense of the blogosphere world and tracking blogs or other one-off posts.  But, who is your audience here?  It seems that you are aiming at the skilled developers who will be answering questions, but I thought the intention was exactly the opposite.  I thought the intended main audience was for people who needed to learn and didn't want to look it up in a book.\n\nHere's the crux of the issue.  You have x posts on the front page and a search box.  Now, I know that if I came looking to find out how to, say, use lambda expressions in C#, that the search is going to give me a bunch of garbage that may or may not be related to what I want.  Or maybe I'm just lazy and don't want to search... which will apply to a lot of people.\n\nThe easiest thing for me to do?  Hit 'Ask a Question' and say 'How do I use Lambda Expressions in C#?'.  Now that post is on the front page and every skilled developer is more than happy to answer it because you've set up a Points Reward Game.  It doesn't matter that there are now umpteen-billion Questions with the exact same subject and answers.  It doesn't even matter that the person who answered it answered the same question a hundred times already... because, yay, more points.  And now the Search function is even more useless because it will return all these one-off garbage Question and Answers.\n\nNow, you might think, we'll just punish the developers who contribute to that... But don't.  Don't ever punish or discourage in any way the people who are contributing their time and knowledge to others.  Your site will quickly become a ghost town if you do.\n\nNow, what's the net effect here?  If a Question that you are looking for isn't on the front page... it might as well not exist and you'll just Ask a New Question.  The site's usability degenerates into a Question of the Day site or, basically, you're just duplicating the function of a Forum.\n\nThe current design encourages this...  If this is going to be a reference site, wouldn't it be better to have sections and categories?  Then a newcomer would go to the C# section, scan the current non-archived Questions on Lambda Expressions and see if the answer they need is there.  If not, *then* they can Ask a Question.  I'd offer that they shouldn't even see the option to ask until they've looked at a certain section/subsection.\n\nAnd maybe not even have a 'Recent Questions' list prominently on the front page?  You could maybe move that to another page so that interested Question Answerers can scan it, but it shouldn't be the main focus of the site.\n\nMy two cents on the design.  I'd like to see this site succeed, because I think it could be a valuable resource for many people at all levels, but I think you might need to take a step back and reconsider your design approach."}, {"author_name": "Shannon", "gravatar_hash": "1204456b59157047dc7cd9717a93e876", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 26, 2008", "message": "Just an additional thought:  If I'm new to a language and I'm trying to learn, the search is definitely useless when I don't even know what I'm trying to find.

Instead, it looks like you are building a social networking site for programmers.  These are two completely different things.\n\nThe focus of the main page is \"Top Questions.\"  What does that even mean, in the context of a reference website?  A question may have an easy, one-line answer, or be a more complicated issue that provokes a real discussion and have various ways to answer it.  But a question should have a boolean value: answered or not answered.  I can see it now: \"Vote up if you want to know how pointers work!!\"\n\nSites like reddit and digg survive on \"churn\": the constant introduction of new links to bored users.  That's why you get so many complaints when there are repeat posts; only new content is worthwhile there.  But on a reference website, the old is not only useful, it is better than the new.  So the old, existing questions and answers should be promoted over the new.\n\nI suggest, first off all, that new questions not even be on the front page.  New questions should have a page, with a related RSS feed, that can be monitored by those who like to answer questions.  It should be easy to filter this page, to only show topics that the user is familiar with.  Why should a PHP programmer even see new questions about C#?\n\nThe front page should be like the front door of a building.  Instead of letting everyone congregate in the entranceway, people should be encouraged to explore the building, and find the room with people who share their interests.\n\nTherefore, the front page should 1) introduce new users to stackoverflow and its mission, 2) be a place where community news can be posted and discussed, and 3) act as a portal to the more interesting, topic-specific sections of the site.  Please see the Wikipedia main page for a look at a better, but not perfect, front page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page .\n\nI love the idea of stackoverflow and want it to succeed, but these issues need to be thought out more carefully."}, {"author_name": "csmba", "gravatar_hash": "e8ec9371b0173179ee41dd68e0e80ddd", "author_url": "http://someofmythoughts.blogspot.com/", "date": "Jul 26, 2008", "message": "1. the \"importance\" of an article I assume is some kind of magical formula.

It looks very much like a social news site. Such sites thrive on new content, and usually have very poor search features since most users simply couldn't care about what was posted a week ago. I could probably count on 1 hand the number of times I have wanted to find an old article on Reddit or HN. I don't object to you having the questions as the front page on your site, it's a question site - that's why we're going to go there. I don't want to have to click through a news front page or similar to get to the real content. However rather than following the stripped down model of social news sites, I think the search and tagging features need a much more prominent place on the front page. Remember most users will probably go to stack overflow to get answers, and that should be a key focus of the design. Search should be the focus of the page, along with your tagging system - they should not be relegated to a box in the corner and a tab at the top.\n\nIf the user can't find an answer, only then should they post a question. You don't really want users posting questions before searching so the 'ask' button shouldn't be as central as the search box (pointing out similar answers as the user enters their question is a brilliant idea btw). Of course once a user has searched, found nothing, and finally posted a new question that question should be easy to find. Now you can take some cues from the social news sites (but not that many). Why put answers with lots of votes on the front page? Those are the questions that have been answered, you don't need those ones on the front page. You are the opposite of a social news site in that you want the newly posted unanswered questions without many votes or answers on the front page. You might think that you want to showcase the really good answers on the front page, but they are going to fall off the front page soon enough anyway. When a user comes to your site they will notice those questions first, and if they know about the topic they might just answer it. Once it's gotten a decent answer or has been on the front page for a while it can be then be found via it's tags or through your awsome search system - no need to keep it on the front page any longer.\n\nWhat happens when a question isn't answered? Maybe you should split your search and tag results into two. One column for the best and most relevant results and another for recently posted unanswered or poorly answered questions. That way it's easy to get unanswered questions if I'm looking to help someone and it's just as easy to get results if I'm looking for help myself.\n\nAnd one last silly idea - if a user repeatedly answers haskell questions (for example) you should tailor the front page to show the type of questions they usually answer. However that's only going to work if they are logged in..."}, {"author_name": "paul celi", "gravatar_hash": "8218051965d32ae09c6591948081c1ec", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 26, 2008", "message": "&gt; Yes, I wish I knew the answer to this.. at the very least edit history will be shown, along with (eventually) the ability to diff changes.

Believe me, I don't want it to look like the Joel on Software forums but there has to be some middle ground.  No navigation, or categories at all, just tags?  If anyone asks a question that's even mildly obscure or untrendy (let's say JSF component design technicalities, or GWT questions, or SQL performance tuning), seems like it would fall off the front page pretty quick and it would force experts to take a long path to even find those questions, let alone answer them.\n\nI want this to succeed, but I don't think you've solved the UI yet.  My imagination was something like a streamlined wiki, where users could really dig into a particular topic by drilling into categories and following links between articles.  Questions would come in through the front page and get tagged, farmed out and categorized as users answered them.  Questions with no responses would get moved into a particular queue monitored by experts in that area.
