That's a poor rant. You don't need to Open Source to get real comments (this is real, isn't it?), professional (like this?) comments with different experiences. \n\nIn fact with OS you could get 900 useless rants about using fedora over ubuntu, how MySQL is faster than PostgreSQL and how Python/Django would have been better than Ruby on Rails and ASP.NET, etc. Somewhere in between the 900 posts, you can find some profesional, real, with different experience comment.\n\nWith Closed Source, you don't get any.
