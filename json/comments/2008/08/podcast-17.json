A revert-function can be very harmful if you are trying to build a wiki-like spirit, and should just be used for obvious vandalism. Look at wikipedias policy on this matter (if you haven't done it already). They just let admins revert, regular users can't do that one-click-revert thing.

The result obviously the same, but it's just a bit more hassle for regular users (which is good, I think). \nIn StackOverflow's case, obviously the owner of the post should be able to rollback the edits easy. What I meant was that if you are considering to enable rollbacks on a more general basis for non-owners, that has to be done with care and consideration.\n\nLet's say someone edits Joe User's post and changes three sections. If Joe User disagreas with some of the changes, it's better to make him remove some of the changes, instead of just revert the whole post. It's a fine line between making it easier to remove vandalism and preventing people from removing good edits contained within edits they disagree with. \n\nAgain, I know you are not wikipedia, but let me reference a good policy there.. and yes, even at Wikipedia they do not agree on there things :P\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Rollback_policy\n\nSince the feature hasn't been coded yet, and I haven't even seen stackoverflow, I will not argue any more, and instead go to sleep, since it's 6.45 in norway now =)"}, {"author_name": "mmp1", "gravatar_hash": "83bcb6a6206265dc4456d6ef85c9b80d", "author_url": "http://www.missingmatterproductions.com", "date": "Aug 13, 2008", "message": "Firstly, great to hear more from the team.\n\nSo my observations so far (like anyone cars right) :\n\nIf you are really interested in not being labeled as a .NET shop/site, it might help to cut down on the .NET fanboy stuff.  I am not saying PUSH other technologies.  It actually sounds more like that Jeff really knows MS Dev tools, so that is his world view he talks from.  Which is fare enough but..  \n\nFor example - the focus on MS providing all solutions for your development process.  True they do a good job , but their are projects (products) out their that do a better job.  One example was your discussion on build/testing/deploy.  So what is my point - it sounds like you guys know MS stuff really well, and many comments sound like \"i have one hammer\".\n\nAnother area to cut down on the .NET branding of stackoverflow - be careful putting other technologies down.  From a business point of view (which I think stackoverflow is ?) you wish to build a community of all technologies.  Listening to the podcast, it very much sounds like its MS here only.  ie. Defending .NET stack versus say a PHP stack (I personally think they both can be made to work well and badly) by saying \"well PHP sucks for websites\" isn't helping your branding. Its things like that.\n\nWith regard to build, is there a tool like Maven for .NET.  If not , have a look at Maven.  There may be some Maven .NET artifacts/plugins that you could use.  There is a small learning curve, but given the complexity of full on web build, test and deploy this is a small price to play.  (Does anyone know of similar tools for windows ?)\n\nHave you considered \"upgrading\" the workflow for marking a post as harmful ?  ie. a weighting system ?  Require more than one vote?  Weight the vote by badge rating?\nSome sort of signoff by users with a minimum of credit?\n\nEnjoying listening to the \"process\" of bring the site to life is great.

Listening to your podcast it seems the .NET community is a couple years behind Java's in development process.  \n\nThe fallacy that unit tests increase development time has long been discounted in the Java community.  Why run the whole app to test when you can short circuit the process and just execute the code under development.  Also, you shouldn't \"go back\" and write unit tests; you should write them _first_.  The new definition of legacy code is \"code without tests\"; .NET guys should know that by now.  \n\nMoreover, QA in the Java community has gone far beyond unit testing, embracing into the mainstream practices like code coverage, static analysis (Findbugs), advanced IDE refactoring, mock testing, code modularization (OSGi), etc.  If you're serious about the quality of your work, you better get on board with these concepts.\n\nProper Java builds (based on Ant/Maven) are self contained and never depend on the installation of an IDE or libraries (ridiculous notions, both), except, of course, for the JDK and build tool.  So, setting up a CI server is easy.\n\nGood podcasts, tho. Gives good insight into the dark side.\n\nP.S. You might want to try Hudson as your CI tool.  I think it has better MSBuild integration."}, {"author_name": "Andrei Rinea", "gravatar_hash": "ea70b38ea893494ee0cd177adc0f54e5", "author_url": "http://andreir.wordpress.com", "date": "Aug 25, 2008", "message": "@Jeff : Regarding the correct pronounciation of Stefan Ciobaca's surname (which I think is romanian, like me) I can help out :\n\nChaw-buh-cuh."}, {"author_name": "Kurt from Florida", "gravatar_hash": "218dd8026929110aa3369d645b447884", "author_url": "http://www.leucht.com", "date": "Aug 26, 2008", "message": "Great podcast, guys.
