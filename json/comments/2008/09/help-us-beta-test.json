You go to Google to get answers, you go to Wikipedia for answers. What bothers me about sites like EBay is that there is an inside group and the rest of the people are outsiders, based on usage;  which puts up a barrier to people who occasionally want to sell something.  Not everyone is a store owner dumping their overstock.\n\nI Haven\u2019t seen the beta but have been following since the beginning here, from what I understand you are trying to create a community of programmers  which to me goes against what you want, and that is a great site to go to for answers about programming. There is a huge difference between a community site and a resource site, how they are structured and how the users treat them.\n\nIf you set up a feel good groovy utopia community, it will have a cycle that will implode on itself, because people want to find a place where they belong and it becomes to personal, some people will want to go there to hangout even if it serves no purpose, well other than to boost their rankings.   Groups get formed, people take sides, arguments become part of the banter for the sake of bantering and entertainment instead of the search for knowledge.\n\nI saw the problem when you posted about rankings, I left a comment then but I\u2019m pretty sure it went unnoticed as maybe this one will too. In my opinion community web sites are an exercise in futility, but a resource site is priceless.  Wikipedia has no names, faces, listed users or personal rankings, just information that can be useful to the person searching to answer a question.   \n\nHaving searchable topics on how to solve a programming problem answered by whoever knows the solution is ultimately the goal.   Creating rankings and badges and personalizing the hell out of the place is not consistent with the end goal.   2 years from now when someone searches for the answer nobody will give a rat\u2019s backside who answered the question; the only important thing is the answer.\n\nBut hey, that\u2019s just my opinion.\n-dan"}, {"author_name": "Justin Bennett", "gravatar_hash": "421597da2c2a5f9cdaab8fa700435caf", "author_url": "http://jmbennett.org", "date": "Sep 11, 2008", "message": "You know you were asking for a question titled just that...\n\nhttp://beta.stackoverflow.com/questions/56582/how-do-i-make-a-peanut-butter-and-jelly-sandwich"}, {"author_name": "Drew Maxwell", "gravatar_hash": "c0124eab47b9e3cf32a6480ebb2862ad", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 11, 2008", "message": "I guess another way too look at it is that people are upvoting these types of questions.

Of course I think you already know this, and that's the goal of the whole voting scheme.  What you need to take into account, though, are untintended consequences.  The unintended consequence of losing your own rep when you vote people down is that people won't vote down bad questions because they value their own rep more than having good questions on the front page.\n\nPerhaps one solution is not to cause a user to lose their own rep when voting down questions, only answers. You could also increase the rep hit for asking a bad question.  If everybody who asked a bad question lost 20 rep points per downvote, it would probably significantly cut down on \"discussy\" questions.  Of course the unintended consequence of this is that you end up with typical anonymous internet user downvoting everything just because they like screwing with people on the internet, or because they're mad their own question got downvoted. \n\nSo what it comes down to is you want people to downvote stuff, but not too much stuff. It's a tough balance which requires competing incentives/disincentives.  A simple rule like what you've got now, just giving a rep hit to the voter, cannot accomodate such a balance.  Perhaps you could limit the number of downvotes per day, but give no rep hit for the voter.  Or you could give a few \"free\" downvotes per day, and then start the rep hit for the voter after X downvotes.  And I am speaking for questions only here, not answers, because I think the downvoting aspect is more relevant to questions than answers.\n\nJust something to consider."}, {"author_name": "Gishu", "gravatar_hash": "69772f0246d5013d72703967b8761e89", "author_url": "http://madcoderspeak.blogspot.com", "date": "Sep 15, 2008", "message": "How about marking questions as \"discussion\" or some such special tag - where it gets relegated to some special sandbox and off the front-page.
