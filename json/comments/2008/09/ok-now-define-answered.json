Thus, you are going to drown out questions that still don't have an answer.\n\nI don't think it will help to raise the number of upvote limit either, because the niche questions often don't get viewed or voted on as much as the more general questions, or questions in technology that a lot of people know, and you may even see people voting on answers just to get them off the unanswered list.\n\nI think this problem NEEDS to be solved, and I'm glad you are working towards fixing it, but I think this solution has missed the mark... though I hope I'm wrong."}, {"author_name": "Morten Christiansen", "gravatar_hash": "ea47536e95c0a6fff1affa1584b61722", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 30, 2008", "message": "It's interesting you are bringing this up just now as I have been thinking about the usefulness of 'answered' questions.
