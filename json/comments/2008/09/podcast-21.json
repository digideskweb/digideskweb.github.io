Before someone's banned, you almost always need a moderator call before you push the big red button.\n\nThe \"flagged\" users idea works as a tool for other users  to gauge someone if it's used correctly.  I'd prefer to see it as a feedback system similar to Ebay.  The users are allowed to exist, but the rating they have lets the other users determine their abrasiveness and/or ability to apply a reliable answer.\n\nAs I'm sure everyone here would agree.. the IT culture has a number of personality types. I've known plenty of brilliant people who have zero personality or people skills.  I've known people who have managed to be well liked by everyone, but really aren't terribly great contributors even though they try.  Considering one of this site's goals is to build based on solutions, it might not be a wise choice to ban someone just because they interact in a cold manner. \n\nXBox has a good way of rating people.  You can submit feedback about other people on Live based on their play style, attitude, etc.  Then as a user, you have the option to ignore/avoid these users and the system separates you when it's matching up.\n\nI know that doesn't completely apply here, but the idea might be twistable enough to work in a forum-ish environment."}, {"author_name": "Tom", "gravatar_hash": "9e4fe1f8165eeb9b947a8102d7a9220b", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 14, 2008", "message": "One constant frustration I have with your podcast is that you never introduce yourselves.\n\nWithout introducing yourselves I have to guess (or wait for sufficient context to figure out) who each speaker is.\n\nA simple 'Hi I'm Joel' and 'Hi I'm Jeff' would make listening much easier.\n\nThanks!"}, {"author_name": "Shaun Austin", "gravatar_hash": "d6c392552f0147de5213e7689d3c68f2", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 14, 2008", "message": "@Tom you mean you can't tell???\n\nHere's a tip:\n\nThe guy tippytoeing around trying not to say something that causes Joel to launch into a tengental rant is Jeff.\n\nThe guy who goes off on tangental rants at the drop of a hat is Joel."}, {"author_name": "Kevin M", "gravatar_hash": "173cfbfa3ef0cc7d19d5bd045b2eab5b", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 14, 2008", "message": "@Dan...I agree completely.\n\nI would urge Jeff to focus more on the impact of unwanted behavior on the Community, and not so much on converting the corner-case users who behave as if attention starved.
