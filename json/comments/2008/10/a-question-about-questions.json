I actually expected to see this take the form of a backlash against editing, but closing seems to have become the lightening rod for it. Perhaps this is because tag editing, wiki-mode editing, and editing of one's own posts allow a bit more of a staggered introduction to the system, while the system for closing is almost opaque to users with &lt; 3K rep points. So while editing is still less open than perhaps it should be, the *impression* is that it is generally available while closing is restricted to some sort of undeserving cabal.\n\nJeff, you actually seem to help reduce this by simply closing a few questions yourself, leading by example. That said, I fully expect this attitude to persist in *some* form regardless of how many people have access to the feature or are familiar with its behavior. Seeing your question closed just feels like a put-down, and users who feel so injured will always find some excuse for their attitude: whether that's ignoring Stum's long history of *good* Q&amp;A in favor of picking out a handful of subjective and OT responses, or just throwing a tantrum and yelling \"censorship!\" \n\nThat's the Internet for ya...\n\nMike Stone's reply embodies a somewhat more high-minded ideal: that voting alone will result in a self-policing site. This attitude persists on many other sites, but is is helped greatly here by Joel's endorsement. It sounds great: Democracy FTW! In practice, it rarely works for this purpose; all it takes to subvert voting as a means of content control is a *temporary* majority of active users who find the topic in question appealing and up-vote it. Programmers have broad and varied interests, and almost anything can and will find an accepting audience: non-programming IT questions, rants and put-downs, commentary on last night's football / hockey / cricket match... You'll see it on every newsgroup, forum, and message board, and although resented by those users *not* in the OT majority, it generally does no harm... but, for SO, the cost is higher, as such \"popularity\" voting subverts the entire reputation system. After all, why take the time to post a detailed, well-researched answer when a rant on the Cubs will take less time and gain more rep? Not that all or even most users would willfully game the system that way, but when even a few users do so it ultimately de-emphasizes the efforts of all on-topic Q&amp;A... Again, see Barry's post.\n\nBTW, Barry: you're missing the point if you think \"holding lots of cards\" is the purpose of using SO.

I have tried to focus mainly on technical questions, and I think my rep history shows that.\n\nWhile I have found that some subjective or controversial questions tend to attract more attention and hence more votes, that shouldn't really be the fault of the person that posted it, if something gets a bunch of votes you should be looking at the people that voted for it.\n\nOne thing you might be missing Barry, is that high rep users tend to spend a lot of time in the site, looking for interesting questions to answer or ask.

It's easy to glaze over the issue with the low close question number.

I know you have posted on your blog about low power machines too, so if you can talk about it on your programming blog, why not people ask it on your programming forum?\n\nThe next 2 that I reopened were VM questions:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/151327/sharing-files-between-vm-and-host-using-virtual-pc-2007\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/152901/horrible-vmware-keyboard-shortcuts\n\nI use a VM every day at work nowadays, so using one effectively is pretty darn important to me.
