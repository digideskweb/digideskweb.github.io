The full-text engine is just burning too much CPU to answer the queries.

It's a bummer, because I wish they could get instantaneous results built from scratch for every page view in real time, but sometimes caching is a better answer than changing architectures or a costly rebuild.\n\n@Paul Baturn - the 2008 client tools don't offer every feature when operating with SQL Server 2005.

There're indeed scenarios where it would be slower, mostly due to the massive rearchitecture of FTS that was done in 2008 to integrate FTS with the database engine. We also know of a couple of issues that we're looking at for a future CU. \nThere're key scenarios where FTS in 2008 is dramatically faster than 2005, particularly on \"mixed\" queries that have both relational parts (filters, joins) as well as search predicates.\nThe 7646 traceflag workaround you mentioned is targted at a specific case where there's contention between inserts/updates and queries. It will only helpful when such contention exists.
