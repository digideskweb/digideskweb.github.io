Also good: the reddit guys, the digg moderators. I remember listening to an interview with one of the Flickr moderators, where they said one of their rules for users was \"don't be creepy,\" that was an unexpected rule and an interesting interview. Ooh! And definitely try and find whoever is \"responsible\" for overseeing the YouTube comments, that will be a hoot of a show.\n\nI'm always interested in the software behind online communities; you can go straight to the source and interview an author of a specific wiki implementation (maybe Ward Cunningham himself?), or interview one of the forum software vendors and ask them why certain features exist, what they had to remove. Interesting questions like \"why did you have to add a CAPTCHA to the search box?\" Questions that sound ridiculous, unless you're talking about a website available on the anonymous web, where there are spiders and worms and the mafia and massive botnets leased by the hour.
