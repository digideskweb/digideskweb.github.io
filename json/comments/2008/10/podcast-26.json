Great podcast, as always!\n\nI like the idea of asking for a \"verified\" real address. User also has to sign a disclaimer, something like: \"Remember: we have long hands and know where you live. So if you do something nasty, we'll come and get ya!\"\n\nAnd you should ask for a bank account. So if a user makes a bad comment, he has $1000 deducted from his account straight away.\n\nAs for the karma system, it's too simple. You should have something like RGP style: different ratings for Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, etc. And also mini-quests. There has to be mini-quests, like \"Go there and answer that questions\", and as a reward you'll get an artefact, like Golden Keyboard of Wisdom or something, that blows your karma through the roof for a limited time."}, {"author_name": "Eli Courtwright", "gravatar_hash": "bd42b746d79be5dd325a8e94bc00ac58", "author_url": "http://courtwright.org/", "date": "Oct 17, 2008", "message": "In this podcast you discussed some kind of a reputation cap.  The main reason why I wouldn't want to see this happen is the \"bounty\" system that's been discussed on uservoice and will eventually be implemented.\n\nI can't count the number of times in the past I've had a really obscure problem involving some combination of libraries, and I'm looking forward to being able to go onto Stack Overflow and post a detailed description and say \"200 reputation to whoever can solve this incredibly weird threading issue involving these 4 functions\" or some such.\n\nOnce this exists, being able to build up more and more reputation is not just fun, it's actually acquiring a valuable resource that I can use in my professional life to help me solve my problems.\n\nStack Overflow is great, but really complex questions that require the reader to look through a lot of code and be familiar with a weird combination of libraries are tough to get answers for.  This is why I'm looking forward to the bounty system so much.
