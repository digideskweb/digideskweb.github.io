I understand that this wouldn't work well with multiple simultaneous users, which is why the questioner should probably get a final say."}, {"author_name": "Esko Luontola", "gravatar_hash": "520c9c078b8d25980de17b8d4fe0ceba", "author_url": "http://www.orfjackal.net", "date": "Feb 07, 2009", "message": "The problem is that when the question has been around for some days, weeks or months, the motivation for a new visitor to write a comprehensive answer which answers the question better than any of the existing answers, is very low, because when the answer is not visible on the first page of answers, very few will actually read the new answer, because of sorting the answers by votes.\n\nA better system would take into consideration the time that the question has been around. Maybe also its length in words. When a new question has been posted, it should be visible near the top of the first page, so that visitors will see the new post and decide whether they vote it or not.\n\nThe sorting order could be a function of how many unique people have read the answer and how many of them have voted it. For example a question has an old answer which 1000 people have seen and 10 people have voted. It has a vote ratio of 10 / 1000 = 0.01. Now a new answer comes. After 10 people have seen it, 2 of them vote for it. It has a vote ratio of 2 / 10 = 0.2, which means that this answer is probably better than the old answer with more votes.\n\nAnother way would be to calculate the weight of a vote as a function of when the vote was done, and then sort the messages by the sum of the weights of all votes. The weight of a vote could be for example 1 / AGE, where AGE is some value which grows (linearly or logarithmically) when the vote gets older."}, {"author_name": "andrew", "gravatar_hash": "fe56269a388c1b60bf89cd94329c1177", "author_url": null, "date": "May 21, 2010", "message": "wat is to be done about guns"}, {"author_name": "Ramy Al Zuhouri", "gravatar_hash": "f464f2449f9d975560e5ed1bbafe7a4a", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 08, 2013", "message": "Who visits a page is often searching for a fast answer, and may be too lazy to choose over many answers. So he will probably choose the accepted one, which often is the one with more up votes. \n\nThis creates a virtuous circle for who answers correctly and fast, even without quality. Once up voted it will be at the top of the page, and some users will see and up vote only this one. Also the reverse, that is a vicious circle may happen: I have observed that some goats may even keep down voting a correct answer is it has a negative score.\n\nSo you can understand well why answerers prefer speed over quality. A virtuous circle is hard to break, and this will be the ultimate goal of who answers. Stack Overflow reputation system is too simplistic : it considers an answers read 100 times and up voted 5 times better than an answer read 10 times and up voted 4 times.  \n\nTo fix this behavior they should fix the reputation system, there isn't another valid alternative. SO is more similar to social networks where reputation is strictly related to popularity, but the goal shouldn't be popularity, rather having technically and well written answers."}]}
