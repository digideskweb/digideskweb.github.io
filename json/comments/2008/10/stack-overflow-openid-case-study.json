The big problem in my opinion is that the popular providers are all doing it 1/2 way, thus negating the purpose. You can use your Blogger or Yahoo OpenID anywhere that supports OpenID, but you can't use your Blogger OpenID at Yahoo or vice-versa. This really dilutes the point. Until the big guys get on board in earnest, I see no way that OpenID can make serious progress. It's effectively just \"Passport\" all over again."}, {"author_name": "Andrew", "gravatar_hash": "ea442197bd2ee7338492a786b0d64455", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 23, 2008", "message": "The thing that got me with the login process at StackOverflow was that when you choose the OpenID provider, the text box is editable and there's a list of examples just below, so I chose flikr as my provider and then thought I had to edit the field so it matched the examples, e.g. http://www.flickr.com/photos/*myname* which seemed to work but then I got the \n\nUnable to log in with your OpenID provider:\n\nfailed to authenticate, returning Failed.

Your argument implies most people have different usernames and password on all sites they visit and thus OpenID is dangerous. But this is false. The vast majority of people use the same login credentials on all the different sites they visit.Thus, for them, OpenID is as secure and a lot more convenient.\n\nAnd I am not alone in believing that a new technology that improves a situation for most people is a successful one.\n\nIn my opinion OpenID will make the web more secure for the common Joe. For one they can quickly and easily change their password for the whole Internet. Which also makes it easier to use a stronger password. And I can trust a single party (eg. MyOpenID) to make their login methods secure, rather than trusting a hundred different sites, most of whom are startups who have more pressing things to develop than a secure credentials repository.\n\nI agree it is not as clear cut as this.
