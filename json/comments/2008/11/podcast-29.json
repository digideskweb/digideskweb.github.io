I don't game much, but I find the games I most enjoy are the ones with a really good story.  My favourite game is HL2, which had a fantastic story.  I played Doom 3 for a bit, but quickly gave it up because there wasn't much in the way of story (I was just killing lots of zombie alien monster things), and it scared me s***less.  It looked fantastic - awesome graphics and lighting effects (particularly with the torch), but I didn't find it very playable.  \n\nHaving said that, I really enjoyed Portal which didn't have a lot in the way of story, but kept my interest very cleverly with the puzzles, the amusingly quirky voice-over, and the hook of always progressing to another level.

Over time the vine died because you cut it.\n\nThen toward the end of the game you needed it alive, of course at this point it was completely dead and you couldn't go back, so you had to start all the way over again.  \n\nIf was very frustrating that you didn't know if the results of a choice at the beginning of the game were right until you made it to the end of the game.
