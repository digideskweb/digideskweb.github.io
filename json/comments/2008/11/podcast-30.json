You've got to <em>listen</em>, Atwood. Also, to Joel: you shut up! ;-)\n\nSecondly, I can't believe you waded back into the NP-completeness issue only to demonstrate that you <em>still don't know what you're talking about</em>. (Joel wasn't faring much better, either.)\n\nThere's a difference between the complexity classes NP and NP-complete. A decision problem is in NP if it can be solved in nondeterministic polynomial time or, equivalently, if a solution to the problem can be checked in polynomial time. \n\nA problem is NP-hard if any problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time (i.e., the problem is \"as hard as (and maybe harder than)\" any problem in NP). An NP-hard problem is not necessarily in NP (e.g., a problem might take exponential time and also be NP-hard).\n\nIf a problem is <em>both</em> in NP and NP-hard, then it is NP-complete.\n\nA <em>defensible</em> interpretation of you statement (\"Nobody can define what makes a problem NP-complete, exactly\")&mdash;one provided by commenters on your blog&mdash;is: though we can precisely define <em>that</em> a problem is NP-complete, we can't nail down what property of the problem <em>makes</em> it NP-complete. For example: Why is 2-SAT in P, but 3-SAT is NP-complete? Why is the fractional knapsack problem solvable in O(n log n) time, when 0-1 knapsack is NP-complete?"}, {"author_name": "Paul", "gravatar_hash": "0e89e85f7684c5aac4f1c96149f8de93", "author_url": null, "date": "Nov 20, 2008", "message": "This is my first time listening to your show and had to shut it off after the first 4 minutes.

Wikipedia articles on CS and Math are not really very good for the simplest introductory explanations that you appear to want to find. In fact in this area you might need to read quite a bit before you really understand the problem.\n\nI realise that your original reason for stackoverflow.com was that people never read books and just want quick answers to (hard) problems, but sometimes if there is a greater depth of understanding needed then books are really useful. I know you still read book as you have talked about many on your blog. If you feel passionately enough about these CS problems then maybe you should go read some introductory CS degree text books and report back with some blog entries on what you have found.\n\nTim"}, {"author_name": "Grom", "gravatar_hash": "a14537020ec5b11fea3b956353724860", "author_url": "http://grom.zeminvaders.net", "date": "Nov 23, 2008", "message": "&gt;Honestly, I have yet to read an explanation of NP-complete that really works for me.

Don't get me wrong I've been listening to the podcast since day one and will continue to listen because it's fun, informative and entertaining. The others here who are also making a similar comment about the NP-completeness stuff are probably in the same situation as myself, in that we have a detailed understanding of NP-completeness. The problem with this is that, like the area of Algorithms and Complexity in general, it is very nit-picky about being extremely accurate and precise with the details - and correctly so.  However, if all you need to take from the NP-completeness topic is that there is a set of problems that are (currently) hard to solve quickly using a computer then that's fine.  The problem with a more detailed discussion about these things is that unless you have a pretty concrete understanding of these things the lack of accuracy can appear painful to a listener who is in the know.  For example, things like \"NP\" meaning \"non-polynomial\", which I'm sure I heard Joel say - I could be wrong though.  My fear is that someone listening then thinks this IS what it means so the (mis)information spreads.  So why is this little inaccuracy so important?  Well someone might think that each problem that is NP-complete cannot be solved in polynomial-time, but the truth is we don't know if the problem can or can't be solved in polynomial-time. This is, literally, the million dollar question. I'm not trying to be fussy here as I thought that Jeff's original discussion on his blog was great from a point of view of educating people that such problems exist.\n\nAlso, I posted a link to a blog post (http://www.equivalence.co.uk/) that I made about NP-completeness (titled NP-completemess) over at Coding Horror when Jeff first had this discussion.  I tried to make it a less formal discussion on NP-completeness that I hoped someone could take something from - maybe I failed but a few friends have said that it helped them, so if you are struggling with the wiki articles then maybe it will help.\n\nSorry or going on for so long, but hey, you have got to be passionate about something.
