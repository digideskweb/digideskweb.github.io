The argument is basically that doing math teaches you to work with abstractions, something that is also needed when programming.\n\n\u201cBut software engineering is all about abstraction. Every single concept, construct, and method is entirely abstract. Of course, it doesn't feel that way to most software engineers. But that's my point.
