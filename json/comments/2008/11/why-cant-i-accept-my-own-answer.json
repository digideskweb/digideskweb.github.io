This system actually works pretty well, but it's inefficient. The person who helps me out gets rep points for it, and I get to accept what I determine to be the RIGHT answer. The only (very, very minor) issue is that somebody gets gifted with reputation for something they didn't think of themselves.\n\nWhich also reinforces the point that it's totally not about reputation.

(I couldn't add the detail until I understood what I was doing wrong in the first place!) But at the end of the day the SO repository wins.\n\nThe goal of SO (I think) is to build a repository of information that helps people now and in the future. Anything that supports that goal is Good. Not doing something good because of fears of reputation-gaming might just be an indictment of the reputation implementation rather than of the original idea. \n\nWhy not allow the questioner to accept his own answer, and automatically make that answer AND the question community-wiki? I wouldn't worry about people trying to earn reputation because--to the man--every single person has said \"allow me to do it in such a way that I gain no reputation.\" I would even accept a penalty (5 points?) if that means I can improve the repository.\n\n(Which brings up a related point that improving the repository is nearly thankless as far as rep is concerned.

Very few people are going around SO blindly voting up accepted answers.  People vote up answers if they found them useful.\n\nMoreover, of all the reputation gaining schemes available, self-answering and accepting would be perhaps the least efficient and effective.  Anyone who cares enough to game the system would be much better served by your garden variety sock puppetry and collusion.\n\nWith a zero-rep-gain rule on this action, the only way to actually gain any significant reputation from votes on self-accepted self-answers is to convinces the community to consistently vote you up.  And guess what you have to do to get that to happen: provide quality content!\n\n(As for your -10 rep idea, if the blind voting attractiveness of accepted answers is so great (again, I don't think it is), it will swamp a mere -10 penalty.)\n\nBut this all misses the point. Bottom line: do you care more about closing every possible theoretical(!) loophole for ill-gotten reputation, or about the the satisfaction and happiness of the legitimate users of the site, and the quality and volume of the content?

The more reputation you have the more content changes you can make. The system learns to trust you when other SO users vote for the content you contribute.\n\nIf reputation is an indication of how much you *know*, then asking a question shouldn't result in any rep gain. That only makes sense if it measures the quality of the content you've contributed to the site.\n\nIf reputation measures the quality of the content you've contributed, then there should be no difference/penalty for answering your own questions as long as the community considers your answers to be \"good\".\n\nAs far as accepted answers being more likely to get votes, that's just a bug in the system. Answers near the top *will* get more votes. The best way to get votes is to (correctly) answer a question early (while it's still \"hot\"). An answer that's accepted after the question cools down isn't going to get many votes, despite being at the top of the list. The Fastest Gun in the West problem is baked into the core of SO.\n\n(Hell, a lot of times the person who accepts the answer doesn't/can't even vote for it!)\n\nAnd anyway, it makes sense that the accepted answer will attract votes: in theory, it's the best answer to the question.\n\nAnd why is there so much angst about gaming the rep system, anyway? Reputation is just a measure of how much you've contributed and a proxy for how much you can be trusted not to break things.

They have distinct meanings in your mind, which I think differs from how the community sees it.  \n\nUnlike Google, the ultimate authority on whether a question is answered is the *asker*.  They may not be able to explain everything when they ask, but they sure as heck know when they have solved the issue they ask about.\n\nIf they post a question, get many answers, and post a different answer that works and accept their own answer, the page will look like this:\n\n*QUESTION*\n*ANSWER THAT WORKS*\n*ANSWER THAT WORKS AND MIGHT BE BETTER*(Voted up)\n\nIs this bad?
