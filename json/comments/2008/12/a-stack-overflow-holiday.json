The ability of users to act as moderators is in no way related to the reputation score they have. The argument I heard you make in the podcast, that reputation is a measure of how much the system trusts you, is fallacious, given how reputation points are easily earned through \"soft\" questions, and the actions of some high-reputation users (witness the fighting that occurs over whether a question should be closed). \n\nOver time, there will be more and more users with reputation over 10,000, hence more and more unqualified moderators (no offense intended to any 10,000+ user reading this).

You can't always rewrite history to cover up all your little mistakes, we all make them, get over it.

Sometimes you answer the wrong question and look like an idiot, so you quickly delete the mistake. Sometimes you post something snarky and then the first cup of coffee kicks in and you reconsider your harsh words so you delete it. A few people may have seen it in the meantime, but it no longer appears in the public record. \n\nIf I had wanted my deleted posts to be visible, I wouldn't have deleted them. This site is **like** a wiki (sort of!), but it **isn't** a wiki. Deleted posts should stay deleted, and invisible. And no one other than the author should have the ability to undelete them.\n\nIf I cannot make a mistake with some expectation of privacy, my enthusiasm for pouring some knowledge into the site is lessened.
