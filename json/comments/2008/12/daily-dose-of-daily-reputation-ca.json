If it is closed and then later deleted, the question will be reasked, there will be no question to refer to saying \"duplicate\" and ... well, it will be a nuisance.  It won't happen for a while.  It may not happen if good questions are kept open.  But it would be silly if we lost the corpus of good answers to good questions because they were closed.
