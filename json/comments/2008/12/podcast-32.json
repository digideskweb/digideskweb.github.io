For instance, they find the word sequence \"kernel handle\" in a programming book, and search for it in the other books.  It turns out this sequence almost never shows up in other books/normal text, so they extract this sequence and consider it to be an important term for this book.\n\nSo you're basically using the usage of words in the text itself (compared to other texts) to detect word sequences that are significant.\n\nThey had a specific name for this (some TLA I think) - and also a page on their website explaining it, but I can't find it now.\n\nBut maybe this info is enough to seed some crazy search plan in Jeff's mind :-)\n\nMy instinct is this may be CPU-intensive though.
