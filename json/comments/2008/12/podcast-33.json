If you already know this, which is quite possible, please disregard. There's a lot of caching going on, and a lot of that caching is not all that necessary. \n\nTo give you an example: When we moved from SQL Server 2000 to 2005 our small database was using around 50MB of RAM, without any manual adjustments to the SQL database. It would actually not grow beyond that usage. When we switched to SQL 2005, the same database started growing and growing. After about a week it could reach 300MB. Eventually it would stop growing, but this difference from SQL 2000 and 2005 got me wondering why it's using so much RAM. It turns out the caching mechanism in SQL 2005 (and I assume in 2008 though I haven't checked) changed, and it's much more aggressive, but that does not mean that the performance is severely impacted if the RAM fills up. I ran a test and actually set a limit on the amount of RAM it can use. I first set the limit to 100MB, no change in performance -- at least not visible --, then I went lower to 50MB, same thing, then I went even lower to 30MB and then finally to the minimum of 16MB. To my surprise it seemed to be just as fast using 300MB as it was using 30MB. This was probably an edge case and the load was probably not all that high. I did, however, investigate further and found this query (sorry I can remember the source):\n\nSELECT\n      (CAST(SUM(CASE LTRIM(RTRIM(counter_name)) WHEN 'Buffer cache hit ratio' THEN CAST(cntr_value AS INTEGER) ELSE NULL END) AS FLOAT) /\n      CAST(SUM(CASE LTRIM(RTRIM(counter_name)) WHEN 'Buffer cache hit ratio base' THEN CAST(cntr_value AS INTEGER) ELSE NULL END) AS FLOAT)) * 100\n      AS BufferCacheHitRatio\nFROM \n      sys.dm_os_performance_counters \nWHERE \n      LTRIM(RTRIM([object_name])) LIKE '%:Buffer Manager' AND \n      [counter_name] LIKE 'Buffer Cache Hit Ratio%'\n\nThis query will actually give you a ratio of how much of the database is cached. From what I read, if the percentage is below 90% you should consider adding more RAM, otherwise you won't notice all that much of a difference. All of my databases are between 98% and 99%. \n\nWhat value do you get for StackOverflow's database?\n\nPeter.\n\n(pbz on StackOverflow)"}, {"author_name": "Jeff Atwood", "gravatar_hash": "51d623f33f8b83095db84ff35e15dbe8", "author_url": "http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/", "date": "Dec 12, 2008", "message": "pbz, interesting info, I get\n\n99.8930317848411\n\non the stackoverflow database server.
