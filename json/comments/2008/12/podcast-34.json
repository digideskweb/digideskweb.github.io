The interview comes from the now out of print Programmers At Work.\n\nhttp://programmersatwork.wordpress.com/bill-gates-1986/\n\nOne question I particularly liked:\n\nINTERVIEWER: Does accumulating experience through the years necessarily make programming easier?\n\nGATES: No. I think after the first three or four years, it\u2019s pretty cast in concrete whether you\u2019re a good programmer or not. After a few years, you may know more about managing large projects and personalities, but after three or four years, it\u2019s clear what you\u2019re going to be. There\u2019s no one at Microsoft who was just kind of mediocre for a couple of years, and then just out of the blue started optimizing everything in sight. I can talk to somebody about a program that he\u2019s written and know right away whether he\u2019s really a good programmer. If he\u2019s really good, he\u2019ll have everything at the tip of his tongue.\nIts like people who play cress. When you\u2019re really into playing chess, it\u2019s easy to memorize every move in ten chess games, because you\u2019re involved in it. Other people look at that recall in chess players, or in programmers, and they think it\u2019s like some freak show. But it\u2019s completely natural. To this day, I can go to the blackboard and write out huge slabs of source code from the Microsoft BASIC that I wrote ten years ago."}, {"author_name": "Patrick Harrington", "gravatar_hash": "c3fa7cc39c502467700f7aa870963983", "author_url": null, "date": "Dec 18, 2008", "message": "Yeah, Joel, you had the RAID 0 and 1 reversed.  0 is striping, 1 is mirroring.\n\nAn easy way to remember is that with RAID 0, 0 is the number of bytes of data you'll have after one of the drives dies."}, {"author_name": "kip", "gravatar_hash": "c621039e41aef415ad25054da3bf3f9a", "author_url": "http://www.vacant-nebula.com", "date": "Dec 18, 2008", "message": "One web app with an easter egg is Google Reader, which supports the Konami code, which skins the app with ninjas.\n\nGoogle Maps used to have something kind of like an easter egg--if you put directions from (say) new york to london, you would see \"swim across the atlantic ocean\" as one of the instructions.

I was a IT admin full time for 11 years and we had the same philosophy you mentioned concerning control over the servers, so we built and ran our own systems.  After having done this, I would never do it again.\n\nAt one point we upgraded hardware and installed bright, shiny new IBM servers.  It was the day before New Years eve, and we did it so that if we had problems it would be a slow traffic time and we could correct them.  Two of us went down (the datacenter was about 50 miles away) early in the morning and installed the new hardware.  After everything was up and running we ran tests and started getting data errors in our backups.  We were down there until late, finally thought we had it figured out.  Came home, got about 4 hours of sleep and had to go back down there.  Finally got it resolved about 6:00pm on New Years Eve.  Totally sucked.  Turned out it was some kind of problem with the raid controller driver or something (I don't even remember now).\n\nAnyway, to make a long story short(er), I think onsite admins who have experience with their hardware and OS, do a much better overall job and are worth paying for.  If building and managing your own servers is just an educational endeavour, that's great, but from a business perspective I think you would be better off having professional IT support.  \n\nDon't take this the wrong way, but it's interesting to me that Joel has such strict criteria for hiring developers, but would support letting a programmer be an IT guy."}, {"author_name": "Jeff Atwood", "gravatar_hash": "51d623f33f8b83095db84ff35e15dbe8", "author_url": "http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/", "date": "Dec 23, 2008", "message": "> Jeff, what\u2019s the title of the book of algorithms you studied at college please?\n\nIt's the classic\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262032937"}, {"author_name": "Srinivasan R", "gravatar_hash": "1930ca279c8f4f19263d26952c7098d1", "author_url": "http://blogial.com", "date": "Dec 30, 2008", "message": "How about the zooming on Google Moon to view the cheese surface?"}, {"author_name": "Patrick J", "gravatar_hash": "d13c16cb15cd0a22161dcdce9f159d10", "author_url": null, "date": "Dec 31, 2008", "message": "Could somebody please get Joel to stop saying \"irregardless\"?"}, {"author_name": "Sara Chipps", "gravatar_hash": "05cd0c924cba660419d5a8ad2a2a107e", "author_url": "http://girldeveloper.com", "date": "Jan 06, 2009", "message": "HDMI cables might be a good gift for gerd (girl nerd).
