I totally agree with you: continual learning is one big reason why coding is awesome in the first place. I'd have a lot less job satisfaction if I didn't have new problems to solve every day.\n\nThe second part of your answer, though--with the example of the date format in a grid--hit on what I was really asking. It's not just a matter of continual learning, which can be totally empowering. The hard part is the *trivia* - the fact that, in order to work with some new technology, you have to learn the little rules and gotchas all over again. That's learning, sure, but it's quite boring as learning goes; it's often just memorization of things that are nearly arbitrary in the first place. Would you rather learn how to, say, use MFC to make an icon blink in the Windows 98 taskbar, or instead spend that time getting a better understanding of a subject like conditional probability? All learning is not created equal, and we only have so much time (especially as we get older and our priorities change, as @Jared suggests). \n\nSo that's part of the answer: you have to be able to filter the world and keep your attention on the important things, while learning enough of the minutia to successfully get Frankenstein's monster to come alive.\n\nYou also made a good point in that there are SO MANY details in modern programming, nobody could ever know them all, nor would it really do you much good if you did. To get beyond that, you have to rely on just-in-time learning to fill gaps as needed. I think that's the earmark of someone who's going to have a long career as a programmer: the ability to confidently answer any question with \"I don't know, but I can learn.\" If you back that up with (a) strong CS fundamentals, (b) good research skills, and (c) persistence, there's little you can't master.\n\nThanks!"}, {"author_name": "Ian Varley", "gravatar_hash": "f671bc1d0b48c1b03402cd6fe2c369c6", "author_url": "http://www.ianvarley.com/", "date": "Jan 02, 2009", "message": "Hmph ... the comment markup changed my closed up m-dashes to hyphens.

For me, although the learning and curiosity were factors, the real draws were solving problems and efficiency.\n\nI won't speak for others, but for me (in many cases) new languages and ever-changing technology does cause the very exhaustion that Ian Varley described. Learning the newest fad languages often means learning the new cool way to do the same thing you could already do. This is the opposite of efficiency and is stressful to keep up with.\n\nLet me be clear: learning new useful tools and techniques is incredible! But truly useful additions to the discipline are rare. It most often feels like I'm just endlessly trying to chase the latest fad because in 2 years, some moronic interviewer is going to expect me to have 2 years of experience with whatever becomes cool this year and happens to have a few years of staying-power before the next fad hits. Yes: it's tremendously exhausting."}, {"author_name": "Sergey Stadnik", "gravatar_hash": "eccdcfacff0a3aa150b47431fedb2006", "author_url": "http://sergeys-tech.blogspot.com/", "date": "Jan 04, 2009", "message": "This was the best StackOverflow podcast ever! Thank you for turning to the human side of programming and programmers. And, guys, change fatigue is real. This is why Joel doesn't know many 50-years old programmers - they just burn out by that age. Every now and then I hear that in order to remain employable in this business programmers have to keep up to date with modern trends and techologies. Otherwise they risk waking up tomorrow realizing that all their skills have expired. But but people who have jobs and families just don't have time to follow that rapidly changing area. They have to stretch themselves.
