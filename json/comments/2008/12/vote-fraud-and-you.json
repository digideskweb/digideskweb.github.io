I can understand how people feel hurt by the whole thing though.

I respect Daok a lot; I've upvoted some (several?) of his answers. I generally like his comments. But I'm kind of surprised by his behavior on this discussion.\n\nGuys, rep ain't nothing but a number. Somehow I have almost 4,400 rep points -- I don't honestly think I deserve but maybe half that! (There are people far more talented than I with considerably fewer.)\n\nThere are too many people placing too high an emphasis on this number. I've seen comparisons to RPGs, people discussing whether or not a potential employer should consider SO rep, whether or not it should be on a resume/CV, etc. That's insane. It's not meant to be an indicator of your knowledge, your technical prowess, your manhood. It's meant to indicate what the community at large thinks of you.\n\nAnd if one member of the community thinks so highly (or negatively) of you, then your number is skewed. You want to leave the community? Go.\n\n(I was not aware of Daok's scripts, by the way. While the act of writing the script is cool, the act of running automated scripts to close questions is absolutely not. Those of us with high rep are given that power because it is presumed we're familiar enough with SO to exercise judgment. Just as red light and speed cameras cannot exercise judgment, neither can a script. Bad juju.)\n\n@Jeff:\n\nOverall, I think you're on the right path. You might want to do something to put some of the doubters' minds at ease, though short of posting the code (or at least query) I don't know what that would be.\n\nI understand people are hurt by the loss of their points. It's easy for me to say \"it's just a number\" (as I did above), as I didn't lose any. (Though I like to think I wouldn't have held it against you if I did.)\n\nI am worried that we will lose good contributors -- but I'm more worried about the motives behind some of them, now. Anyone threatening your site in a public forum like this is an issue. Anyone who takes this little integer field so seriously that they would not only leave a site, but threaten to unleash bots on it, is a severe problem.\n\n(On a side note: I guess this is what happens when a site hits the big time? I should be so (un)lucky on mine!)\n\nRegardless of any other fixes, you might want to be on the lookout for bot behavior in the near term.\n\nTo All:\n\nSO is, in my mind, a great site. It's not perfect, but it has helped me out quite a bit, and I like to think I've helped out some others as well. I could be insane, but I thought we were all participating in it for that reason: To give and receive competent advice from fellow developers, to engage in good conversation with some of them (yes, I know, against the FAQ; we seem to anyway), to learn and educate. That's why I'm here -- even if I have been in more-or-less lurker mode for a week or so. (Hey, it's a busy time of year!)\n\nNo site is perfect, and SO is the same in this regard. No technique for dealing with abuse or potential abuse is perfect. But it sounds to me like Jeff tried to do the right thing, and unfortunately some people who may not have known things were happening got caught in the crossfire. \n\nI hope we can all put this behind us soon.

The implicit \"you cheated and we found out\" tone of Jeff's original article about just made me mad. Having only my BlackBerry available at the time I didn't feel like reading more than the blog post itself, so I missed the ongoing discussion in the comments.\n\nI'm sure the anger many people felt comes from the not very sensitive wording and the genuinely bad timing of the whole thing. Now that I have read the comments to this post, I feel my anger diminishing.\n\nI understand the reasoning behind the measure. I noticed the anomalous up-voting but as many others here just shook my head and moved on. I still can't agree to how it all has been done, because it feels like undeserved punishment. It has some smell of the politician's fallacy (Something must be done / This is something / So we must do it). But at the same time I am unable to come up with a better fix.\n\nI just hope the detection mechanism is tuned against abuse, because the abuse pattern is quite trivial, as others have pointed out. \n\nRegarding the voting behavior of @HS (as an example) only three words come to mind: WTF?! I don't even understand the justifying rationale. Serial up-voting someone trying to keep him ahead of someone else because [insert reason here] is laughable. And arguing that it must be okay because the system lets me do it is laughable as well. I can just shake my head over this, but I appreciate the honesty.\n\nI don't know if making a vote a more precious and rare thing could help preventing anomalous voting. Currently nothing stops me from gaining the trivially low amount of rep required to start voting and do so wildly and indefinitely. Casting a vote should be the result of thought.\n\nThe amount of up-votes available per time period could be coupled to reputation and/or the number of own up-voted answers/questions (e.g. \"activity\"). Voting the same person multiple times per time period should be capped to make vote distribution more even and vote assignment a more thoughtful process.
