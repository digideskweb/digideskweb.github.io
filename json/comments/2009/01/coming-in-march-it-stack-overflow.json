And hence there will be a lot of questions that are not very conducive to learning of others.\n\n\nDescription:\nThe difference between programming and IT is that IT encompasses everything from LDAP to \"how to setup my mother's printer?\".  The difference between these two questions is that in the former I have to be interested in IT (whether by job or personal interest), - I must want to know the answer to get something working and I want to know it so that I know in the future how to do it.  The latter question is asked when the person does not give a damn about IT, but is having problems with some printer and some device; the person does not necessarily want to learn anything, just wants their damn printer working.\n\nIf we go back to stackoverflow.com, for one to ask a question, even the most basic one, one must be interested in the answer.  One will cherish the answer and remember it, they care about the question for the sake of the knowledge (not to print their paper due in class tomorrow).  This care results in them doing some research ahead of time, going thru at least one barrier before they ask the question.\n\nFor IT this would include people who are in the IT industry and IT hobbyists, which are the people you want on the site.  And would exclude Joe the Plumber who wants to print at his mother's house a schematic of the pipes so he can go fix them.  This matches exactly what the target audience was supposed to be in podcast #37.\n\nAn example of a site similar to stackoverflow but for a difference audience, where based on the subject you know the people passed at least one barrier is:\n\n\nExample:\n\nTopic: Electrical Engineering\n\nName: shortcircuit.com\n\nQuestions: How different components work, how to setup some circuits, etc.\n\nAudience: Electrical Engineers, hobbyists setting up their own electronics, college students of Electrical Engineering (very easy extension from current users of stackoverflow.com)\n\nComment: there will be a bunch of users from stackoverflow.com that would be able to help in shortcircuit.com, so there will be an initial audience."}, {"author_name": "John Leidegren", "gravatar_hash": "5be12a5a883043ee47443e93217504b6", "author_url": "http://leidegren.se", "date": "Mar 11, 2009", "message": "There's plenty of good suggestions here but I would refrain from anything which is to closely related to programming.
