It sounds to me like your current hosting provider isn't actually hosting your data on the box that you rent.  It's probably a volume on a high-performance SAN with 10k or 15k SAS drives.  I have been very impressed with the performance of stackoverflow so far (and therefore your ability to tune it), but I have my doubts about your new server.  \n\nYou should gather these performance counters from your production machine (Physical Disk _Total):\n\nDisk Reads/sec \nDisk Writes/sec \n\nGenerally what a storage professional will ask you to do is gather these stats for 24 hours and then dump the counter log to CSV (relog.exe logfile.blg \u2013f CSV \u2013o logfile.csv).  Import that into Excel and look at your totals (Avg, Max and 95th percentile).  Add up reads and writes, which gives you IOPS (I/O per second).  That's the magic number that really matters for storage performance.  I think you might expect to get in the neighborhood of 500 IOPS from your 6 disk array.\n\nYou should know *for sure* before you deploy that a local 7200k RPM SATA array can handle your volume.  I don't think it can, unless I'm drastically underestimating things.  Especially since you're planning the new stackoverflow for sysadmins, which will attract a lot of new attention.\n\nI'm also very curious to know how you will be handling your backups (including off-site copies) now that you will be managing things yourself."}, {"author_name": "Eric Z.

So, fo example, if you fork out $1200 for a new 15k 450Gb SAS drive, an average IO operation will take 5.4ms (wow!).  Divide that into 1000 and you get 185 IOPS.  Multiply that by the number of drives in your array, and you get the theoretical max.\n\nBut then you have to account for RAID levels, and the quality of the machine has a lot to do with the multiplier.  I have seen rough figures of:\n\nRAID 10: 50%\nRAID 5:  30%\n\nBut I have seen SAN vendors claim close to (or even higher than) 100%.\n\nAnd the IOPS are always compared to the 95th percentile of your usage, since your average is too low due to lulls in activity, and max is ridiculously high."}, {"author_name": "Jeff Atwood", "gravatar_hash": "51d623f33f8b83095db84ff35e15dbe8", "author_url": "http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/", "date": "Jan 17, 2009", "message": "> You should know *for sure* before you deploy that a local 7200k RPM SATA array can handle your volume\n\nEr, with 24 GB of memory, I expect disk performance to be largely irrelevant.
