This has easily become one of my favorite tech podcasts. Yay!\n\nOK, that's out of the way.\n\nI just wanted to point out that the services GitHub provides are not quite the same as the services of a Bittorrent tracker (although functionally it's pretty similar).  There's nothing stopping developers from being purely peer to peer without any central, canonical  repo.  Of course, if you have a product that you want to foster participation on, it raises the barrier to entry because it's not clear what the best source is.  Nonetheless, it's completely possible.\n\nGitHub provides you with an easy centralized public face to the decentralized ecosystem.  Anything that's ready to be truly published can be pushed there by whoever has  permissions to do so.  If you reference the [IntegrationManager or DictatorLieutenant](http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/#any-workflow), the 'Blessed Repository' in either of those flows would be GitHub.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to clarify that point.

Although the partition is mirrored and so my data is safe, the actual boot sector is not mirrored in such a way as to leave the computer bootable with those drives missing.  (Also, since it's the controller and not the drive that died, I can't swap the second disk into the first disk's slot to see if it will boot, but I'd be highly surprised if it did.  Similarly, if you have hardware that lets you hot-swap in a replacement for the boot drive, I see no evidence that Windows would rebuild a boot sector on it.)\n\nOr, in short -- sure, you can mirror the boot partition, but if you want to boot with a dead drive, you need to actually mirror the boot _drive_, and Windows doesn't mirror drives.\n\nOn the other hand, the computer continued running quite happily with the IDE controller down, until I tried to reboot it.
