The problem is these questions are waiting for the right person to come across them and there is no way to know if that person has joined Stack Overflow or cares enough about reputation to find it in the \"Featured\" question tab.  The odds that they are available to answer the question in the next 7 days seem remarkably low.  More like 7 months (or perhaps 7 years).  I don't need a bunch of answers that flood into a \"Featured\" question which simply rehash the unhelpful advice I already have.\n\nI love the idea of a bounty, but this isn't really a bounty in the strict sense.  A bounty would offer a prize for getting the correct answer.  For instance, mathematician Paul Erd\u00f6s offered prizes for a variety of unanswered mathematical questions.  But the prize money would only go to those who provided correct answers.  For that to work, someone (Erd\u00f6s himself in this case) evaluate the answer to see if it was correct.  And there was no particular time limit imposed.  \n\nThe current system is closer to turning the doubling cube in backgammon.  If you feel the answer you are looking for is very likely to be provided with a small incentive, you turn the cube.  This raises the ante of the game and increases the odds it will end right then and there.  But it also has the potential to make losing much more painful if the game turns against you.  Once you make that decision, it is irrevocable and out of your hands.\n\nI'd suggest a simple criterion for judging the success of this bounty system.  If more than about 50% of bounties end in a questioner accepted answer, the system is probably working.  If more than 50% end in an automatically selected answer, it has failed.

Obviously, bounty points should be part of the 200 rep cap at all. \n\n@SO team: you do realize that by introducing a \"7 day\" limit, you add an \"ebay\" component which is not there in the  about page (http://stackoverflow.com/about).\n\nThat means you *demand* that your users alter drastically their behavior and monitor their question in a very different way.\n\nAnd of course, that fails: See http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/pages/general/suggestions/115548-bug-bounty-points-incorrectly-attributed-to-my-answer"}, {"author_name": "VonC", "gravatar_hash": "7aa22372b695ed2b26052c340f9097eb", "author_url": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/6309", "date": "Feb 04, 2009", "message": "Unbelievable...\n\nThe bounty system has one serious flaw (this auto-accept system which makes no sense whatsoever).\n\nOf course, it is not long before it starts to go wrong.\n\nI try to make things right (http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/pages/general/suggestions/115548-bug-bounty-points-incorrectly-attributed-to-my-answer)\n\nAnd all I receive is the middle f... : declined as \"working as designed\" ?!\n\nInstead of assuming the defaults of an \"ebay\" feature which has no place in the original design of SO (See about page http://stackoverflow.com/about), the SO team simply ask us to get lost.\n\nNice.\n\nAgain, for the earing-impaired, trying to put the role of currency to the reputation points is ridiculous: those are two very different items, managed in a very different way. They are by nature **incoherent** (i.e \"without logical or meaningful connection\", \"different or incompatible by nature, as things\")\n\nNot all need to be scratched: the \"Featured\" panel is a good idea (as the number of \"Necromancer\" badges can attest for).\n\nThe rest needs to go, and the concept of long term question status management need to be seriously re-designed, and addressed in a way which respects the original intent of the SO site."}, {"author_name": "dacracot", "gravatar_hash": "f410fbf6f72198a97b0a08489c4aeaaa", "author_url": "http://tox.sourceforge.net/", "date": "Feb 04, 2009", "message": "So my 500 point bounty question currently has one answer which is incorrect and has -1 votes.

You took a \"gamble\" and you may lost.\n\n\"Gamble\" has always been part of SO. Before bounty, you gambled on the generous, disinterested and altruistic behavior of your peers.\n\nNow you have to forfeit the very acknowledgment your peers has given you (rep points) in order to gamble and loose reps, or even get screwed by the SO system itself (if a crappy answer gets selected).\n\nThe fact that you may get a good answer in the process is moot: the end should not justify the mean.\nI.e: the mean (bounty) is inconsistent with the end (get an answer for an old question), because rep points and currency are not the same thing (hence the inconsistency).\n\nBy introducing a bounty system, SO team forces an \"ebay\" system where users need to respect a dead-line, notion unknown until now.\nNaturally, most of them forget the dead-line, which results in an automatic choice of the most upvoted answer (even though it may have been written *before* the bounty, which makes no sense whatsoever).\n\nTo pretend that rep points are not currency is just willfully turning a blind eye to the reality of the situation: look at ebay: it does need 2 separate ingredients to function properly: currency and reputation. And it is widely complex to manage.\n\nAgain, bounty has nothing to do with SO original vision."}]}
