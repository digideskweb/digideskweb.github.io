I understand why you went with OpenID, but, really, OpenID is so kludgy.  I can barely get my head around most of the ramifications of using OpenID, and yet I'm supposed to get non-technical users to do this (on other sites, I mean)?  \n\nOpenID is a valiant attempt at a solution to the extremely annoying and insecure multiple usernames/passwords problem, but it falls so completely short of being a workable solution it is almost unusable.\n\nBut, like I said, you guys are doing the best with what is out there."}, {"author_name": "JazzHands", "gravatar_hash": "c705c1d246a9887cbe656dd870a9537a", "author_url": null, "date": "Jan 03, 2009", "message": "Matt - Please explain why it is almost unusable.

I find OpenID very pleasant to use.\n\nMy process for signing in, before today:\n\n1. Visit http://www.stackoverflow.com, click Login\n2. Type in the longish URL for the semi-obscure OpenID provider I made the serious mistake of selecting when I established my account, which isn't even listed in the dropdown anymore\n3. Be confronted with a page telling me I need to sign in to the semi-obscure provider, but which doesn't give me a link to do so to prevent phishing\n4. Type in the URL of the provider, enter what I believe to be my credentials, click Login\n5. Be told that my password is incorrect\n6. Try an alternate version of my usual password, click Login\n7. Be told that my password is incorrect\n8. Remote Desktop to my home computer, launch Firefox, click Tools, click Options, click Security, click Saved Passwords, scroll to the URL for the provider, click Show Password to find out what password I used for this stupid site\n9. Close Remote Desktop, return to provider's site, enter newly remembered password, click Login\n10. Return to Stack Overflow, attempt to log in again, finally succeed\n11. Forget why I needed to come to Stack Overflow in the first place\n12. Seriously reconsider whether any of this is worth it\n\nOpenID is still kind of a mess, in my opinion, but at least now I can log in with my freakin' Google account.
