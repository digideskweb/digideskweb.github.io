According to Alan, he found the original question using an automated search alert just like Atwood had guessed.\n\nWe then proceeded to discuss how it's sad that identity is still hard online. For example, it's hard to prove if I'm telling the truth here in this comment. As for that, the best I can offer is to look at the picture on my blog and then look at this picture from the Summit \n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/cglusky/3195351350/in/set-72157612501297914\n\n(Alan is on my right)\n\nAlan is a great person to talk to because of his huge experience in the computing field. \n\nHe's currently working at the Viewpoints Research Institute (vpri.org) where they're doing some classic PARC style research of trying to do for software what Moore's Law did for hardware. A decent explanation by Alan Kay himself is at http://irbseminars.intel-research.net/AlanKay.wmv . For specifics, you might want to check out the recent PhD thesis of Alessandro Warth, one of Alan's students: http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2008003_experimenting.pdf\n\nOne of the greatest lessons I've personally learned from Alan is just how important computing history is in order to understand the context of inventions. One of Alan's greatest heroes is J.C.R. Licklider (a.k.a. \"Lick\"). Our discussions a few months ago led me to read \"The Dream Machine\" and write a post about it: http://www.moserware.com/2008/05/who-is-this-licklider-guy.html \n\nA consequence of studying history well is that you'll notice that a ton of the really cool and interesting stuff was developed in the ARPA-&gt;PARC days and it's been slowed down since. I'd assume that's why he's curious about anything post-PARC's peak days (e.g. 1980+).\n\nI'd say that Alan firmly believes that the \"Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet\" (still) even though he's been talking about it for decades.\n\nFor example, see his '97 talk at OOPSLA: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2950949730059754521 \n\nand this video from last month at the 40 Year Anniversary of Engelbart's \"Mother of all Demos\": http://www.sri.com/engvideos/kay.html \n\nSpeculating from discussions, I'd say that the problem he sees is that computers should help us become better thinkers rather than \"distracting/entertaining ourselves to death.\" Alan likes to use the example that our \"pop culture\" is more concerned about \"air guitar\" and \"Guitar Hero\" rather than appreciating genuine beauty and expressiveness of real instruments (even though it takes a bit longer to master). Check out 1:03:40 of https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a295153/p99875217/ In effect, we're selling our potential too short.\n\nAnd that's what I think my biggest take away from Alan about computing: computers can do so much more than we're using them for now (e.g. provide \"a teacher for every learner\"). \n\nHope this helps provide some context."}]}
