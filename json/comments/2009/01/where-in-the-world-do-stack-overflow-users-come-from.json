So whenever someone types a question into his favorite search engine and does so in his native language which is not english, it's very likley that he will not get SO results.\nComing from Germany and being in the software industry I know that you won't get around without learning and using english, but you can't force everybody to do so.\nAre there any plans to provide mulit-language support in SO?"}, {"author_name": "Thomas Owens", "gravatar_hash": "8579087f6aad114044755cd7d64a36c9", "author_url": null, "date": "Jan 14, 2009", "message": "I'm curious as to how locations can be plotted using the profile's location field and Google Maps.
