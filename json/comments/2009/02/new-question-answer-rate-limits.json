While this rate limit sounds fine, and I have no complaints about it, the limited number of hyperlinks and the possibility, at least on meta, to get so easily downvoted have made the experience as a newbie to me quite frustrating. Not because of the reputation, but because having 1 rep won't allow those basic features.\n\nI'm pretty sure, just like in this case, those things were implemented with some good reason backing them up. I'm asking here to either reconsider that or give better explanation on why it works like this. At least on my case I'd feel much better if I could agree with the reason behind it.\n\nMy idea would be that, maybe, instead of having to HAVE the current reputation limit to not be considered a spammer, just achieving it could suffice. And, of course, at any time some moderator could revoke that from a user if it becomes clear the user started to behave as wrong as the one in this post. Just an idea, probably not the best, but I still feel something could be made better in that spam prevention system.\n\nAnd thanks for helping on developing such a great tool for us!"}, {"author_name": "Evan", "gravatar_hash": "1c4355386e6ccd2ad6622c55e69f698f", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 21, 2010", "message": "Hello,\nI've just registered, never posted a single question, and I see the 20mn message that keeps me from posting.
