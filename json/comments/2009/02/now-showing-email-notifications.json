This is simply because I know first hand the issues that you will (probably) encounter.\n\nIn order to minimize some of these problems, might I suggest that you implement two simple, light-weight and easy to implement techniques: VERP[1] and SPF[2]?\n\nVERP allows you to more simply trace email bounces and who they were originally meant for by encoding the destination email address within the 'Return-Path' mail header. This tries to eliminate the problem when someone is forwarding their email (or have it forwarded for them) to different accounts. Since you are already generating custom emails per person the major drawback of implementing VERP is negated.\n\nSPF, while I'm not a huge fan, should help reduce the chances of your messages from being flagged as spam. This works simply by adding specially formatted TXT record in your DNS zone file.\n\nI look forward to hearing your triumphant successes, bitching about your failures (and your lessons learnt) in a future podcast covering this subject.\n\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VERP\n[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework"}, {"author_name": "Will", "gravatar_hash": "7a0492b3fd266c7ebd65f3cfce437ebc", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 17, 2009", "message": "I also want to put in a word for the \"don't be a spammer\" party.  \n\nEverytime someone does what you're saying you've done here (start spamming people against their expectations), it pisses in the email pool a little more.\n\nPeople who haven't visited it your site for 60 days might have decided they don't like it.

You don't start by asking for the sale at first impression. You earn the right, over time, bit by bit.\"\n\nIf I were one of those 3000, I wouldn't mind getting a very personal-sounding note from you saying, \"Hey, we see that you haven't been around much, and we kindof miss you.
