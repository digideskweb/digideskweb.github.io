I know that they had to do a little groveling after their comments in #38, but they have done something that I don't think Bob has done recently:  Build Great Software.   Stack Overflow rocks, it is fast and functional and the time to market was very short.   It sounds like Jeff didn't use TDD, didn't use SOLID and still made great software.   Listening to Bob's examples and comments I was left with two impressions: 1- this guy's points are more valid for 80's era C programming than for today's MVC pattern or webforms web development.  2- His examples seemed more textbook than real world.\n\nJeff has the coolest software on the block, and Joel is successful enough to have the coolest office on the block.
