Think of the words that exist in only one language (or the languages from which they were borrowed). Prior to inventing the term \"eccentric\" there was no middle ground, conceptually, between \"insane\" and \"socially acceptable\" (and it says something about the Brits that they invented this word first). Likewise, the German concept of \"schadenfreude\" couldn't have come from any other culture, and outside of Italy there is little appreciation for, or any compelling need to invent a word like \"spretzatura\" to express the idea it represents. And since you mentioned Latin, it's interesting to note that there aren't the words \"yes\" and \"no\" as we understand them in English: they go about communicating affirmative and negative answers differently.\n\nThe point being -- and I agree with Joel on this -- the purpose for learning a new language is to learn the way of thinking, or the world-view that goes with it.
