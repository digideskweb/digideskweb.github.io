I work for a public university and my salary is available to anyone with an Internet connection.\n\nI prefer the university's policy to the bank's policy. The secrecy around salaries exist to benefit employers, not employees. It can benefit employers by 1) making it more difficult for competitors to figure out your compensation to deter \"poaching\" of employees, and 2) as a method of being able to pay employees as little as possible if someone is a poor negotiator. I think that's the primary reason they are a secret. \n\nAll heck *would* break lose in many companies if the \"salary excel file\" suddenly was discovered by the employees. The thing to keep in mind those is that that would be the employer's fault--if there was an objective, equitable compensation system in place then the employer would have nothing to fear.\n\nIf somehow things were reversed and it was customary for people to know each other's salaries then any employer who withheld that information would be looked at as being an employer hostile to its employees (in that regard).\n\nJoel's solution--i.e., 1) your salary is computed in as objective manner as possible, with no negotiating involved or allowed, and 2) you can derive what your peers in the company are paid by your own salary, seems to be a nice balance between openness and keeping some secrets for competitive reasons. Overall, an enlightened system I think.

Yes, sometimes bad developers indicate a sickness in the organization. Sometimes they just happen.\nI've been there as a manager and had to let engineers go because they can not program. The problem I have see is that some software people can code, but can not write a whole program.\n\nI am assuming you are this person's manager.\nFirst, talk to HR. Don't mince words. Tell them this person is failing and you are moving them out the door. They will help with the legal side.\nSecond, talk to the person. Again, tell them they are not doing the job and if they don't change, they will be fired for cause. Put them on a performance improvement program. If it fails they are gone. Make that crystal clear.\n\nThe performance improvement program goes like this. This will require some patience as the manager.\nDivide all their tasks into 1-2 week chunks. No more than four tasks at a time. Talk to them about progress every day. Write it all down, give a copy to the developer and HR.\nThe first time through they will be trying to please, so all four tasks will get done. The second time something will slip, the third they are usually back to their old bad ways. That is why you must be patient.\nGo through Code Complete one chapter per week. Talk to them about it and how they can use it on there current task. \nStart having them schedule how long the tasks should take. If the estimates start to grow to crazy long forever times, this is a failure, note it with HR.\n\nBy the end of this, they have either improved and are contributing, or you have a fully documented list of failings. Problem is solved. Keep them or fire them.\n\nDon't put it off. Joel was right saying they are probably not happy. Don't let guilt or being a nice guy get in the way of the ax. They will be happier in time, so no guilt."}, {"author_name": "romandas", "gravatar_hash": "812cac3d389b39d59bab4d75f02c73f0", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 26, 2009", "message": "Regarding incompetent programmers and finding ways to use them..
