My accounts on different language versions of Wikipedia and other wikis are great examples of this. \n\nAnd as an infrequent user of a service, I might need an activity history even more than a frequent user, perhaps to find communications I've had with people, years ago.\n\nYou may also want to consider that a few people want to or have to put stuff in their lives aside for some periods of time: they may get sick or get children, travel, stressed out at work or school... These instances may be rare, but why risk giving people an even small feeling of completely unnecessary loss, even in such seemingly insignificant stuff as owning one or two cool questions on a Q&amp;A site?\n\nYou've said it yourselves, systems like SO enhance the warm and fuzzy feeling one gets from helping each other out, by being a tad manipulative with reputation points and stuff, and your target audience is described as being prone to obsess over things... \n\nAt least send out expiration warnings by e-mail.\n\nThe relationship one has with a web service is not really \"Real Life human\", obviously.

If you can't muster that, I don't see any point in having an account at all. Just browse the site anonymously, because there's no difference.\n\nAlso, I don't think you guys appreciate how many orphaned OpenID accounts we have in practice; it's trivially easy to \"create an account\" on Stack Overflow by doing almost nothing at all. Can you even name one other site that, like Stack Overflow, *doesn't require a valid email address to register*? I'm not sure I can.\n\nWhen we say lightweight, unlike all those other sites, we mean it.\n\nThe downside to ultra-lightweight accounts is that you have to *do something* for them to stick around.

I think you just undermined your claim of lightweight accounts. They're not lightweight. They have to go through some kind of \"approval process\" before they're allowed to stay. There is nothing lightweight about that.\n\n\"I question what badges you could have of any possible meaning under these circumstances.

Come back when you're serious\".\n\nOnce again, this will never affect me, but I think it's a terrible idea still. If I sign up on a site, I expect my signup to be valid the next time I try to use it. I can pretty much guarantee that if I came back to a deleted account, no matter how inactive it was, I would *NOT* bother to sign up a second time.

Why don't you tell us? ;)\nHowever, unless you're up in the billions, I highly doubt it's a problem for you to keep track of these accounts. Is disk space a problem? Are account-related DB queries becoming a bottleneck?\nOtherwise I fail to see what it is you hope to gain.\n\nYAGNI is a fine principle, but you're applying it the wrong way around. You can't second-guess your users and make decisions for them about what they're going to need. Instead, it should be applied to the question \"do we need to do anything about abandoned accounts?\" \n\nIf my account was deleted, I wouldn't care about the rep or the badges (since I probably wouldn't have any of either).

The thing is that I did posted a question AND I got an upvote. I have 2 badges: Teacher and Student.\n\nIn your comment above you've said it's impossible. But here I am!\n\nI've never checked whether I'm logged in or not and I switch browsers all the time. Now it seems like I'll have to :(\n\nI'm a casual user. I mean I visit SO about once a week or even once a month.\n\nWhy I haven't answered other people questions? Well, most of the time I use Opera and your rich text editor was completely messed up until recently. Because of that I usually type my answer in a separate window (MS Word or OO Writer). When I switch back to the question I _reload_ the page and find a couple of new answers similar to mine. This has happened about 6 times for me! You know, I would rather just upvote their answers instead of posting and keep the number of similar answers low. Otherwise the answer page becomes messed up \ntoo much.\n\nWhy I haven't asked more questions? Because I _search_ before asking and there was only 1 (one!) case when I haven't found the answer and had to ask!\n\nMy question was not an easy-points-generator (What's you code editor of choice, hah?). It's very specific and technical and I still haven't received an acceptable answer. All the answers I received do not seem to be comprehensive and low-level enough to me to really understand what's going on under the hood. \n\nSo if other people are typing faster than me and your search field works better for me than Google why do you blame _me_? At least I sent feedback over at UserVoice a couple of times.\n\nI'm not a DBA and my SQL knowledge are very basic (Hibernate!). But I think that instead of removing accounts from your DB you can partition your users table into active and abandoned according to a criteria you mentioned above. Thus you would make a query for active users only first. Most likely this query would be successful and it would be much faster than it's now.\n\nBut if it failed then you could make a second query for abandoned users. That's how memory caching works in computers. I think you can do the same thing in a DB. \n\nAs I remember you use Microsoft SQL Server which is pretty advanced. I'm sure there's something for table partitioning in it. May be there's a method to pack the data inside the DB if it's rarely used, too.\n\nSo, that's probably it. At least I do not take much space in your database because I don't have an Autobiographer badge :)\n\nTo put it strait: I do not care about all those repPoints, badges, karma, scores, stars and other _social_ garbage. \n\nIt's a Q&amp;A site.\nWhen I have a question I search.\nIf I haven't found anything I ask.\nWhen I see an unanswered question I answer if I can. \nIf I want to socialize I go out with my friends and have a good time.\nKarma? 4*** karma!\n\nJeff, just let me if you're about to delete my account so I could ask some high-karmic retarded question like 'What Eclipse features you would like to see in Visual Studio?'.\n\nGuys, to be honest this is a b***S*** question and has nothing to do with StackOverflow. StackOverflow is about solving problems, not about unproductive noise. If the question above sounds like an interesting to you then go to programming.reddit.com and ask there!\n\nI mean, seriously, you do not post you drunk photos on LinkedIn, you do it on FaceBook. So why do you put so much garbage in SO instead of other web sites?\n\nIf you're curious my question is http://stackoverflow.com/questions/134791 and it was viewed 321 times (nice looking number, imho)."}, {"author_name": "Terry", "gravatar_hash": "4554da4556390e28c7edd02721ab0c64", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 24, 2009", "message": "Thanks jeff for deleting my account; with your overzealous account management \"feature\".
