Segmentation fault (aka segfault) is a programmer thing and not an IT thing. It's what happens when you don't check your pointers and try to access memory you don't have permission to touch. C programmers know it all too well.\n2. Rack Overflow isn't that clever. It just sounds like Stack Overflow and that can't be the main reson to go with the name. I'm all for pictures of women of gifted proportions, but I think that naming route leads only to perpetuating a bad stereotype that we really need to break. \n\nMy suggestions are along the lines of p(e)bkac and bofh (bastard operator from hell). \nenterpriseready.com\nnotenterpriseready.com\nproductionservermadefromspareparts.com has the right attitude, but it's way too long.\nfixityesterday.com ?\nfixthevpnnow.com ?\nserverdowntime.org/net &lt;- I really like this one. It speaks to the life of an IT worker and suggests a relaxed place to share wisdom.

The human problem of course is people don't like change and would rather put up with ambiguity rather than call something familiar by a new name.  I would say that this tends to happen more in IT than in other industries.  I was watching a training video about oil-field equipment maintenance and was amazed at how many terms were being bandied about.  It wasn't that the terms were all that technical rather it was that they had specific names for everything and expected the audience to know the terms.  Think about it, if you're on an active drilling rig, one of the most dangerous places to work, you need to know that when you ask for a wrench you'll get handed the right tool. Another example is a surgeon. There might be 13 different scalpels, let's name them A - M, used for a given operation.  If you ask for the H scalpel you don't mean any scalpel, the G, or the I scalpel.  Of course it helps that a standard set of names exists and learning all the names is part of the expected training for the field.\n\nWhy don't we have standard names for the things upon which we manipulate? My guess would be that as humans we're lazy and that communication is hard.  I'm also sure that our challenge with managing software can also carry some of the blame.  The question is, what do we do? We can't force people into throwing out more terms, like orthogonal, when the communication environment is already crowded with buzzwords.  Where do we turn to develop some standard terms? The ACM? They seem far removed from working programmers. Dr. Dobbs Journal? Maybe but who'se going to consider them the authoritative source?  IEEE? I don't know enough about them as an organization to even hazard a guess."}]}
