Even with a post with a few upvotes, deleting the post is unlikely to cost me rep - because I'll still hit the 200 rep limit, and it's really only the timing and number of accepted answers which affects my daily rep gain. Removing a post may cause a delay to hitting the limit, thus potentially making an accepted answer \"not count\" (in terms of pushing past the limit) but there probably wouldn't be much loss, even if the answer had 10 upvotes. (I think the most popular answer I've deleted had about 4 upvotes, presumably from others who'd misread the question too.)\n\nSo yes, this is \"easier\" for me than for most people - but even so I'd urge you to put the benefit of posterity above the benefit of rep. I'd be the first to admit that rep doesn't really mean much in concrete terms - it's an indicator of time spent, quick fingers and a persuasive communication style as much as anything else. On the other hand, having a more focused set of answers *does* have a concrete benefit to the world, IMO.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I wonder if I shouldn't be a bit more ruthless with my own answers.\n\nJon"}, {"author_name": "daok", "gravatar_hash": "a147f48a1c8298c71d4bb425b2801224", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 21, 2009", "message": "This time I have not loss any reputation.
