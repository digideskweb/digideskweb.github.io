The community is already able to edit and close questions where needed. The one thing we *don't* need is a moderator who does that, bypassing the usual voting system.\n\nModerators are useful because of the extra powers they're given. Not just because they do the same as the rest of us, only faster and more aggressively.\n\n@Rich B: \"I misspelled it once, and the guy cried about it. I deserve to have a little fun too every now and then.\"\nNo you don't. Not as a moderator. And not at the expense of other users. You get to be abused, and not be allowed to answer back. \n\nYou certainly shouldn't actively *contribute* to turning someone else's answer into a 85-comment long flame-fest. (as in mmyers example). And even if you do, a moderator should own up to it and say \"I fucked up\", and not \"I deserve to have a little fun\".\n\nEnough about Rich B.\n\nSome people above have said a moderator should be a super-active highly visible person. I can agree with active, but visible? I don't see why. The best moderator is one who keeps the site running, and doesn't really get noticed. Someone who *doesn't* close questions or edit them regardless of the OPs wishes, except in extreme cases. Someone who only intervenes when it's actually necessary, when the \"regular\" community is unable to handle the situation.\n\nApart from that, I agree that picking someone with expertise in different tags than the current moderators would be a good idea. Sure, a moderator should try to keep track of all questions under all tags, but ultimately, it's helpful for him or her to have a clue about what's actually being discussed. That makes it a lot easier to spot nonsensical questions, or *knowing* what to edit.\n\nBill the Lizard or JaredPar would make good candidates though. They're active, always helpful, know their stuff, and cover several tags that the current moderators don't often browse. And they seem to have a knack for editing people's questions for clarity, without going too far, changing the meaning of the question, or confusing the OP or people who already answered the original question.\n\nIt's also nice to see someone suggested litb above. I can't say I've really noticed him moderating much (as in editing posts, closing questions and so on), but damn, he knows his stuff, and deserves some recognition for that.

The one thing a moderator should never do, is allow arguments and fights to spiral out of control. And even if he does, a moderator certainly shouldn't egg it on, or *participate* in it.\nAnd no, as a moderator, you would not have the right to make fun of users. Being a moderator isn't all fun. \n\n\"Cherry picking a single instance where I had a disagreement with an author but managed to stay professional about it with the exception of spelling his user name wrong is a bit silly.\"\nCalling your behavior \"professional\" is silly.\nClaiming the sole right to judge your own behavior is silly.\nmmyers did not find your behavior professional. I did not find your behavior professional. The people making the rest of the 85 comments did not find your behavior professional.\n\nThere are several problems here:\n- disagreement with an author: Jeff is looking for a moderator, not someone to argue with posters. You don't have to \"agree\" with everything. If you don't, just keep out of it. \n- the inability to *handle* this disagreement. Intentionally misspelling users names, arguing, fighting, never letting go, letting the entire thread spiral out of control.\n- And finally, your attempts even now, much later, at justifying your actions, defending yourself, taking it all personally.\n\nSaying that we are \"cherry picking\" a single bad instance would have held some merit (everyone has a bad day from time to time), if your answers here hadn't confirmed the same concerns. You have shown pretty clearly, I think, that this was not a single isolated incident, that you are literally unable to let go until you've cleared your name and convinced everyone that you're right. And that you don't like admitting your errors.\n\nA moderator should not be someone who turns any disagreement into an endless argument as here or in mmyers link.\n\nApart from that, I'm not sure I see what the extra moderator is needed for. I haven't really seen a need for more moderators, although I can understand wanting to prototype the process before launching RackOverflow.\n\nA few people above said they wanted stricter moderating on SO, and in a way I agree. I wish there was a clear policy against the \"for fun\" or nonsensical questions. There are plenty of resources for fun and socializing and goofing around on the internet. But there isn't currently such a policy, it would have to be introduced as a conscious decision that is applied consistently, not by voting for a moderator who turns out to be a stricter than the current ones."}, {"author_name": "Paul Tomblin", "gravatar_hash": "99660662e89949a4b53cd97bc199ead1", "author_url": "http://blog.xcski.com/", "date": "Mar 20, 2009", "message": "I'm flattered by all the nominations.

He would be a great super-moderator, but he's very visible and open (ie, he explains what he's doing and why, which only riles people up) - I believe a super mod will necessarily need to step back, let the community police itself, and when they do step in there's no need for explanation.  I believe he's actually very suited to the level he's at, and is good at it.  It's really too bad that that he's getting such a huge backlash - rather than closing things he has made an effort to edit them so they remain open, but the original authors (and others who believe in the sanctity of the original post) would rather see the vote for close than the editing.  But he's getting an unfair amount of flak because he's open and honest about it.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what happens.  However, the people who read this blog are self selecting - make sure that's the intent.\n\nAlso, Roj, thanks for the nomination.  I'm not present enough to take on moderation duties (You'll see my rep goes up in spurts) plus I like voting to close questions that aren't strictly related to programming.  If I was super mod I'd have to stop doing that and only moderate in extreme cases.  There are better candidates than me for that reason alone (ie, I don't want to stop giving my vote to close for inane getting to know you, 'favorite x', job, employment, etc type questions).  Beyond that, I'm not really present on UV, and I'm simply not interested in doing the janitorial work here - being a moderator in any community is arduous, thankless, tedious work.\n\nJoel A:  Good luck selecting another moderator!  Don't get too democratic about this.  Think more \"benevolent dictatorship\" and less \"let the community choose their leaders\".\n\nBut I do hope you can get a few more good super mods so you and the development team can spend more time building the site and less time stopping schoolyard fights.  There are many in the ranks that will do very well, but I honestly recommend interviewing them via phone or face to face if possible.  The interactions on SO, UV, IRC, are relatively limited.  Further, you might consider inviting them to the podcast and officially introducing the new mods so SO users can get to know them a teeny bit more.
