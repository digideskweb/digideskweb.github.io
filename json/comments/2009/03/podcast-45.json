To me, a vision statement should only be specific enough to validate or invalidate future feature design.\n\nFor example, here's my vision statement for MiniBench:\n\n\"Minibench makes it easy for developers to write and share tests to investigate and measure code performance.\"\n\nOh noes! It uses \"easy\" - so clearly it's bad. It doesn't say *how* it's going to make it easy - so clearly it's bad. It's not specific about how you're going to share the tests - so clearly it's bad.\n\nNope. It's great because with that one big idea (which is a really simple elevator pitch as a *starting* point) you can think of as many new features as you like, and say, \"Does that contribute to the vision statement?\" It *encourages* brainstorming sessions, wacky ideas which may or may not go anywhere.\n\nIf your vision statement just goes into all the details of the things you can think of *now* (\"it's going to be heavily multi-threaded and do everything in memory\") that leaves very little room to grow later.\n\nThe vision statement shouldn't be where the design ends, of course, but it doesn't need to be so prescriptive that it stifles innovation. What's wrong with adjectives, anyway? If my goal is \"fast\" then I can experiment with exactly what's going to *make* it fast later.

In a threaded system, the context of that would be obvious - you'd basically have two branches in the notional tree (however that's represented - see later).\n\nWith the \"flat\" version you've got both conversations interspersed, which makes it *really* hard to tell what's going on, particularly if you happen to be a fifth person who's interested in the conversations. It's even worse if one person (A) has two separate conversations with two separate people (B and C) - so both B and C are referring to person A, but not to the last thing A wrote. They're referring to the last thing A wrote *to them*. Ick.\n\nNow, in terms of *presenting* that, you're absolutely right - the normal tree view leaves a lot to be desired. I rather liked trn's way of presenting Usenet - ironically it painted a better \"picture\" than most modern forums, despite being limited to text. You could really easily tell the branch points, where the topic title changed etc.\n\nFlat comments aren't too bad for a Q&amp;A site like Stack Overflow, but they'd be severely limiting for a genuine *discussion* site. If Stack Overflow ever decided it wanted to engage in detailed discussions, it would absolutely have to have a better threading model. I suspect that a tree is a reasonable *model* for discussions - we just need to find a great way to present it. (Giving the option of saying, \"This comment actually responds to more than one previous post\" would be neat too, at which point it's not a strict tree, but that's a different matter.)\n\n(On a slightly separate note, since joining Stack Overflow I've pretty much abandoned C#/.NET newsgroups.

This goes into the theory that punishment is still getting attention which is still more desirable than not attention at all. \n\nIn adults the secondary effect is different as instead of continuing the undesirable behavior for attention, they will most likely either not do anything at all (which could become learned helplessness) or they could quit to avoid an undesirable situation.
