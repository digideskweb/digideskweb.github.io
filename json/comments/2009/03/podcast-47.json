For example, Eclipse was full of (good) Refactoring suppport which Visual Studio didn't really get until 2005, and then it was kind of half-baked. Don't get me wrong, Visual Studio is great, I just don't think its fair to say it was ever beyond Eclipse."}, {"author_name": "macbirdie", "gravatar_hash": "c2ad4d98fcc9c454d09cbb16c6395a83", "author_url": "http://macbirdie.net", "date": "Mar 26, 2009", "message": "FYI, Frontpage is now Sharepoint Designer."}, {"author_name": "Brendan", "gravatar_hash": "4c34af319f5b137438bad65e2a25bf37", "author_url": "http://bjkeefe.blogspot.com/", "date": "Mar 26, 2009", "message": "Joel mentioned early in this podcast that he would have no problem with ads if only he could stop \"flashing.\"  I feel the same way, so I use the Firefox plugin Flashblock:\n\nhttp://flashblock.mozdev.org/\n\nIt works really well.

As well as refactoring, why did it take until 2008 for VS to get unit testing built in? Why is it still only for MS Test? Why is it not in the Express editions? Integrated unit testing with all the really common frameworks for the platform should be something developers can just take for granted.\n\nI tend to think that Visual Studio + ReSharper ~= Eclipse. As I blogged a while ago, I'm somewhat surprised that Microsoft hasn't just bought JetBrains and slapped ReSharper into Visual Studio.\n\n(Note that I'm not really into GUI designers etc - I haven't even looked at what Eclipse has in terms of designers these days. I spend most of my time in an editor, so I want the editor to rock - which it does in Eclipse. I hear even better things about Intellij IDEA, but the times I've tried it I've been underwhelmed.
