For everyone else (people that prefer Linux, or have tried both long enough to be comfortable in both), I don't think free for 3 years is really that much of an incentive.\n\nFree for 3 years, or free forever... why go on the assumption that your business will be successful enough in 3 years to take on sudden costs that you could have avoided from the beginning?  And if the costs are really insignificant at the end, why not evaluate them on their technical qualities alone?\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, it's not as if Microsoft has any real advantage over the alternatives.  C# is admittedly making language advances where Java is crawling, but Rails provides a very rich and easy to use MVC framework with a fully dynamic language to support it (and there are plenty of other languages and tools that will work fine on a non-Microsoft stack).\n\nAs for the actual server hosting... apache has been an industry standard for years, and Linux provides such a rich command line toolset that Microsoft can't begin to compete with (for the time being).  I would be lost without ssh, sftp, emacs, grep, locate, and the host of other useful utilities that makes dealing with a remote server (heck, even a local machine) a breeze on Linux.  There is a steep learning curve associated with them, but having hit that curve for over a year now, I would quickly say it was worth it.  I'm STILL learning new tricks that you won't find on Windows.\n\nI have to agree with Jeff that what you build is far more important than what you build it with, but I don't feel that this BizSpark thing is really anything to get worked up about, unless you live and breath Microsoft.\n\nActually, I would even urge all people that live and breath Microsoft to give Linux a try for a few months... once you get past the pain of not knowing what you are doing, the other end of the tunnel is full of freedom and excitement and new realms of development pleasure you didn't know existed... which is why I personally will never return to the Microsoft stack willingly."}, {"author_name": "Jan Fabry", "gravatar_hash": "91354ef2eccac3d92ab21b03dd0eab80", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 16, 2009", "message": "Before this, you could use \"Microsoft Empower for ISVs\" [ https://partner.microsoft.com/global/40011351 ], which costs $375 per year, and can be renewed once.

That said, I think PHP is easily the worst designed \"language\" to achieve mass popularity. As Alan Kay ( http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523 ) said:\n\n---\nLet's say the adoption of programming languages has very often been somewhat accidental, and the emphasis has very often been on how easy it is to implement the programming language rather than on its actual merits and features. For instance, Basic would never have surfaced because there was always a language better than Basic for that purpose. That language was Joss, which predated Basic and was beautiful. But Basic happened to be on a GE timesharing system that was done by Dartmouth, and when GE decided to franchise that, it started spreading Basic around just because it was there, not because it had any intrinsic merits whatsoever.\n\nThis happens over and over again. The languages of Niklaus Wirth have spread wildly and widely because he has been one of the most conscientious documenters of languages and one of the earlier ones to do algorithmic languages using p-codes (pseudocodes)\u2014the same kinds of things that we use. The idea of using those things has a common origin in the hardware of a machine called the Burroughs B5000 from the early 1960s, which the establishment hated."}, {"author_name": "wds", "gravatar_hash": "01bb891a03442bf5494b7e35804c6dc1", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 17, 2009", "message": "I think it's funny Jeff said \"It\u2019s OK to be proud of your stack if you aren\u2019t a jerk or a bigot about it.\" and people on both sides of the fence started railing about the other stack being crap.
