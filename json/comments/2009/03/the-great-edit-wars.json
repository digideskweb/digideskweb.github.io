Someone who uses a smiley in their post self-identifies themselves as the sort of person who uses smilies.  Often the minor or nuanced portions of a person's writing are the parts that an author most identifies with and is most attracted to.  Like it or not, \"fluff\" carries information about the author as much, if not more than, actual content. \n\nAs for #2, that must be determined by an editorial policy.

The last time I felt this motivated to do so was in a newsgroup post back around 2000-2001 replying to a not too dissimilar baw-heed like yourself. I'm pretty happy with my earlier post, it's pretty much accurate/justified. You're just a nuisance to other SO users, plain and simple and I don't mind using the strongest language available to make that point. \n\n\"Thank you for doing far more than I ever could to discredit you and your accusations (if I would have even bothered).\" - thank you, I'm quite good at this kind of thing. I don't really give a crap about my credit or other self centering/self importance bullshit like that. I prefer speak my mind.\n\n\"I have never used this kind of language on the site or abused a member like you are abusing this audience.\" - aw get off your high horse, you only say that just because you wish you had the balls to do it first. \n\nI await your oh so predictable and imaginative \"your so thick you can only trade insults, your so vile, blah blah blah\" repost. \n\n@Andrew: I agree with you, it's precisely that kind of edit that isn't justifiable or necessary - grammar, spelling, improving the layout, putting a question into a better context etc I have no problem with, but these interfering edits are just self-ego stroking/control freakery. \n\nHis 4:46pm post just proves this point even more, who is he to decide that he alone should change the authors tone by removing harmless greetings and the like?:\n\n@RichB: \"This site is for asking questions and getting answers. The most direct language is the best to achieve this.\" Rich, you've already accepted SO is a community, people in communities like to introduce themselves, hell when I go to my Alcohol and Drugs Anon meetings we all start with \"Hi my name is...\", yet they all know my name from weeks past. It's all part of the conversational protocol of communities like these. Yes the questions are maintained in a wiki-style, but SO isn't a wiki or a strict format knowledgebase. The two key words banded about here are 'community' and 'questions', and community participants, regardless of topic, like to have pre- and post- amble to their utterances. It doesn't make the posts any harder to read, or maybe you read real slow or something and big words like 'Hello' confuse you.\n\n@TheTXI: \"I\u2019ve seen plenty of examples where he has made edits to post that had sarcasm or other humorous quips interspersed in the text that never got touched.\" - this is most likely because RichB didn't comprehend the humour (see below) or wasn't smart enough to understand sarcasm. Nuff said.\n\n@Stone: \"humility\" - a quality sorely missing from a couple of these twits.\n\nRemoving the odd smiley or 'Hi Folks' does de-personalise SO and can also change the initial impact of a question when scan reading. This is especially important if the poster doesn't use English as a first language or maybe has poor grammar skills. Asking a question clearly and concisely, especially technical questions, can be hard for some folks, so some leeway should be allowed. You know, we're not writing PHD thesis papers or technical manuals on SO, it's a community (not RichB) driven technical content self-help site.\n\nA 'Hi', 'Thanks' or a smiley breaks the ice on what could at first glance appear to be a flamish looking demand for an answer rather than a casual/polite request (due to translation mistakes; an OP's language structure for asking a question may not necessarily map easily to English for that individual). It's subtle language nuance stuff like that RichB doesn't seem to get. By all means fix the glaring language errors, but leave the OP's personality and convivial tone alone.\n\nEven in quality discussion services such as DISCUSS.DEVELOP.COM, which were once the cream of .NET Q&amp;A back in the early days, no-one complained about greetings and signoffs and it was even considered rude not to do so. So I don't see why SO/RichB should force posters to ditch traditional polite pre/post amble.\n\nIn this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/613626/\n\nChanging - \"This is the code I have:\" to \"My code:\", WTF? What was wrong with the original sentence, at least document your reasoning on that one rather than an arbitrary edit? The edit just dumbed down the language in the question and could influence how a new reader forms an opinion of the poster (\"oh look this guy is a monosyllabic dolt\") without first seeing the 60 round edit war that went on behind the scenes over something so daft. Why not \"Here is my code:\" or \"Please see my code below:\", or just leave the original the hell alone!? \n\nAs I said, editing out these personal nuances and tones in the questions starts to de-personalise and alter the community persona of SO, and if it continues according to RichB's rulebook, SO will turn into a sterile, dull, dry, boring destination and about as interesting as a stack of lawyers documents. \n\nAs an aside, and as a casual observation, there seems to be a lot of devs of RichB's age group who a) have ego's the size of planets needing continual stroking, b) take themselves awfully seriously, ooh I'm a developer, I'm special, c) appear to have had their humour and personality glands ripped out at birth. They've all flocked to SO because their \"bozo bit\" has been flipped elsewhere no doubt. It's quite sad to see such seriousness and aloofness with this little crowd. \n\nSo onwards....Let me put SO in perspective, the bottom line is that SO is a business, it's there to make money. Jeff, because of his reputation as a popular blogger, and partnering with another popular blogger (Joel), has managed to tap into us, a large pool of expensive, technically savvy, experienced devs (what's your billing rate? mine is GBP1500/day), to spend *OUR* time for *FREE* contributing some pretty high-quality content to SO. \n\nTo give an example: Two answers I contributed took a few hours of spelunking the .NET FW source code to understand some behaviour in the FW. After a couple of months I had a grand total of two upvotes and a correct answer, not much for spending half a day of my time producing fairly decent technical content complete with example code (albeit voluntarily and selflessly). But SO gained more good free technical content to place next to ads on the RHS of the page should someone read it....$$$. This is not sour grapes, this is how this works and you buy in or you don't.\n\nSo obviously SO has to pay for itself and Jeff from advertising revenue (to maintain his favoured lifestyle of being a tier 1(?) tech blogger and swanning around not actually having a real day job :P). Companies will happily pay for said advertising because the content is good and it's a target-audience rich advert delivery environment - but he gets all the content for free - look, cake and eat it!. All he did at the end of the day was assemble a slick ad delivery mechanism driven by our great content - and it works too, because I clicked through an ad to the RegexBuddy guys and bought a copy. I salute the man for his vision and the fact that it will no doubt be very successful for Jeff, the Sponsors and the users (in that order).\n\nSo what do we get for all our efforts? We get the magical mystical rep number indicating how large our technical members are, and maybe some help at some time in the future solving a problem we run into. Not much in return to be honest for furthering Jeff's lifestyle/career/business ambitions, especially when I can use google pretty effectively and the interest shelf life of any question that you do ask which has any non-obvious/difficult to produce solution (i.e. the fastest gun types) is fairly short, even with bounties.\n\nAnyway my point being, why are you pissing away all your free time on quite frankly daft and pointless edit wars when there's nothing in it for you, you're not a stakeholder and you're not getting a financial kickback and you certainly don't own exclusivity to the content (even though you seem to think you do)? Christ on a bike, you hardly even ask any questions to get some kind of return? So why waste hours rolling back some shitty little smiley 60 times that does no harm at all in the great scheme of things? Hell, your type of behaviour could even possibly affect SO's ability to maximise ad revenue because I'm sure the sponsors who stumble across your petty edit wars and must think \"jeez, is this the quality of dev we really want to advertise to, mmm mmm?\". \n\nSo RichB edit-goons, lighten up dudes and stop being knobs, suck it up and maybe admit that your smiley removal edit was wrong after you've had the urge to stamp your inviolable authority/ego for the 60th time on the same sodding article. It's not winning any Pulitzer prizes and I don't think there's an MVP award for SO Stupid Edits. \n\nI bet if messrs Skeet/Gravel/Hewghill/Atwood stuck a smiley in their questions, or a 'Hi Folks', you wouldn't dare touch that, because RichB you're plainly a bully and a first class muppet that preys on the noobs who know no better, or experienced SO folks who just can't be arsed wasting their lives fighting your self-assumed editing authority; and to re-iterate, your edits *are* second rate zero/negative value contributions. \n\nI've seen your kind a-plenty in the office place, clubs, organisations, wherever, and you always claim whatever it is you're trying to pull off is for the benefit of the 'community' when in fact it's all about being in control and 'oh look at me and how I run this so well, I'm so shiny, smart and clever so I am'. Meh.\n\nAnyway, I'm bored with this now and you.\n\nkthxbai. ;)\nKev\n\nps: @Jon Ericson 6:24pm - nice post. Further to your 7:04pm post, RichB has a major PR problem and that's part of his problem. There was a question by a poster around xmas time that was more or less a dup of the OP's original. He was doing a chase up with a second question and I guess genuinly didn't understand the mechanics of the site and how that's a no-no. The first comment from RichB was to tell the noob to \"stop whining\" about not getting an answer. I suggested to RichB that a little politeness goes a long way and predictably we ended up with the usual RichB \"everyone else is wrong I am right, you're all crybabies\" tossfests he usually ends up doing. Sadly the question and comments have now been removed. He really is the most obnoxious forum crackpot I've ever stumbled upon for a long time."}, {"author_name": "The great edit nazi", "gravatar_hash": "680b8d4a9b843a858148493db5ef0164", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 05, 2009", "message": "@gregd: What amuses me is that you don't seem to understand that your analogy is backwards.\n\nYou see, I don't generate noise (calling the cops) by editing.\n\nYou generate the noise with rollbacks, complaints and dishonest accusations.\n\nYou are the neighbor here, and I am the innocent guy getting the cops (Jeff and team) called on him.\n\nNo wonder why you have relationship problems with your neighbors though!"}, {"author_name": "The great edit nazi", "gravatar_hash": "680b8d4a9b843a858148493db5ef0164", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 05, 2009", "message": "@kev: it sounds like you have a lot of personal issues and opinions that conflict with the SO community.

That's obviously your prerogative.  But remember that there's a large group of people reading this discussion, probably most of whom aren't posting, who see intense complaints from you (\"This is so unbearable that it's driving me away\") without much to back it up.  You understand the context of your complaint, but the rest of us won't unless you provide more information.\n\nThe one data point you've given us -- the one post of yours that you mentioned RichB editing -- you rolled back to your original version (for the badge, as you yourself said) and you then rolled it back to his edit almost immediately.

No-one that I've spoken to is interested in driving any productive person away from SO.  Quite the opposite.  Anyone who invests significant time of any sort on the site is clearly interested in the site being useful and successful.\n\nSo please, share with the *rest of us* what is so offensive about Rich B and/or others' edits that you find so unbearable that you are contemplating abandoning SO.\n\n@toast: I am stunned that you appear to think that a majority of edits on SO are not helpful. (Or perhaps you are speaking from frustration and you only believe that a significant minority of edits are not helpful?)  That you would penalize editing ... just makes me speechless.  You would throw out the baby with the bathwater.\n\nI seem to make a lot of the kind of edits that you don't like -- grammatical fixes, capitalization, changing an unclear question statement title into a clear *question* title, and so on.  I feel these edits bring true value.  English is not the native language for everyone.  It's my native language, and I am proficient with it.  If I can clean up another person's grammar so that their question is clear and unambiguous, they are much more likely to get an answer.  Were I asking questions in a Polish forum, I hope that someone would clean up my grammar, as troch\u0119 m\u00f3wi\u0119 po polsku.  (I am not Polish; I married someone who is Polish.)  I feel strongly that edits correcting even small grammatical mistakes bring value, or I wouldn't waste my time doing it.\n\nAnd you seem to measure one's value by whether or not they answer or ask questions, more than by any other measure.  That's your choice and you're welcome to it. I don't share that opinion.  Also, note that RichB has *thousands* of rep points, which he can't get by editing alone.  I edit more questions than I answer.  I feel that I bring value to SO by doing so.  I hope that others agree, but clearly, not everyone will agree.\n\nA small number of very vocal people are clearly tweaked by RichB and Gortok's edits.  To try to solve this by punishing all editing is trying to solve a social problem (disagreement over community standards and over how and when and with how much zeal they should be enforced) with a technical fix.  That is, it won't be successful even if it succeeds.\n\nIf we can come up with stronger community guidelines (stronger in terms of strong *consensus*, not in terms of strong *enforcement* or *absoluteness*), I think many of these other disagreements will become less important."}, {"author_name": "The Great Edit Nazi", "gravatar_hash": "680b8d4a9b843a858148493db5ef0164", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 05, 2009", "message": "@GregD: So your failure at communication and your own failure to make fact agree with your statements here is somehow my fault? \n\nNice try. \n\nI posted the truth and the evidence.

I think my posts and RichB's posts speak for themselves at this point."}, {"author_name": "Eddie", "gravatar_hash": "3d184a8ef609eaabcaabd0dd19196a74", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 05, 2009", "message": "@GregD, whoops, you were faster than I was!  Ah, so it goes.  But anyway, I never asked you to explain \"how RichB could be offensive and piss people off.\"  No-one is saying that RichB will win \"The Nicest Guy On SO\" award, nor would he suggest he is vying for or would care about such a thing.\n\nWhat I hoped you would explain is why a small number of active editors (one or two or at most three, I assume) can so offend you that you would abandon the whole site and the many thousands of people who are active here.\n\nAnd look, the first time one of my posts was edited very quickly after I had posted it, my first reaction was outrage.  *Minor* outrage to be sure, but still outrage.  Then I looked at the edit, realized it was constructive, and got over it.  I do fully understand that part of this conflict is over whether or not all of RichB's edits are constructive, and that there is strong disagreement from different sides on this point.\n\nAlthough RichB is getting tarred with the brush, \"All of his edits are harmful,\" which is not fair, nor reasonable.  Yes, some of his edits are trivial edits, but don't forget that the history doesn't always show all edits made in an obvious way.  An edit that *all* would defend that happens to include removing a \"Hello\" may *appear* to only remove the \"Hello\" unless you examine the history very, very carefully.\n\nAnd I *still* think the best solution and the quickest solution to this conflict is to drive toward a strong community consensus on what function editing plays.  I am supremely confident that if the community at large reaches a strong consensus about what edits are constructive, that RichB and others will modify their behavior to fit that new, strong, community consensus.\n\nI understand completely when one comes from frustration or outrage.  Any large enough community is going to have its share of gruff individuals.  But ultimately, do we try to fix the conflict as a community, or do we just vent at each other and make no progress in any direction?  As someone I used to work with would ask, paraphrasing, \"Do we only contribute to the heat death of the universe, or do we solve a problem?\"\n\nNow that so much frustration has been vented ... can we all try to reach a consensus?\n\nHow about this ... for starters ... just to try to find a middle ground where I think all reasonable people can agree, based on emotional reactions to past edits.  This is a *proposal*.  A starting point, not a finished product.  This is not meant to tar anyone with \"you broke these rules,\" nor with \"why do you whine about this,\" but is instead an attempt to find a productive middle ground:\n\n- Generally avoid editing *solely* to remove salutations and signatures, unless offensive or huge.\n- Generally avoid editing *solely* to change a non-question but very clear question title into a question-structured question title.  (Of course, one's definition of \"very clear\" will differ.)\n- Grammatical fixes and typo corrections are always OK.\n- Changing a non-question title to a question title is just fine if you also make the title more specific or more clear or more direct.\n- When a question is unreadable (usually from someone very new to SO, obviously), large edits are expected and are justified.  Yes, the definition of \"unreadable\" will vary, but a question that's difficult or just non-obvious for a native English speaker to figure out the meaning of may be impossible for a non-native speaker to figure out.\n- When editing for formatting or grammar or typos, it's acceptable to remove small salutations and signatures and \"Thanks in advance,\" as in general these don't add a lot of personality to a post.\n- If someone strongly objects to an edit that meets these guidelines, well, everyone has an ego.  OK.  The smaller the edit, the larger the chance we let the OP keep their version.  Or maybe the editor re-edits in a way that keeps the edits a larger group would agree with and abandons the edits that the OP objected to the most.  Or maybe some 3rd option?\n- What else?\n\nWhen I've edited http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14593/what-is-the-etiquette-for-modifying-posts I make every attempt to go only by evidence for what appears to be the current community consensus (giving extra, but not controlling, weight to those who own the medium).\n\nRather than verbally stabbing each other repeatedly, let's solve the problem.

Jeff, if you're paying attention, we NEED a message board for meta-discussions like this - it gets harder to follow as the number of posts grows! A phpBB (or similar) board would be sufficient as long as it's at least semi-official.\n\nWith regard to the matter at hand, I do think that, as a whole, the open editing of posts has been a net positive on SO. Allowing other people to correct spelling and grammar errors, as well as awkward or unclear phrasing, has the potential to vastly improve the quality of the questions and answers on the site. From what I've gathered from this discussion, the contention seems to be primarily focused on what content and edits are appropriate for the site (i.e. keeping/removing salutations, etc).\n\nWithout giving examples or pointing fingers (as I have none of either) I will instead say that this blog post is (or, at least, was) about edit wars, which are a different issue altogether. With an edit war, you have at least two people rolling back each other's changes to a post, each with their own preferred content. With a normal wiki, such users would be on equal footing, and therefore it's difficult to say which party is right. However, with SO's concept of content ownership, such edits can (perhaps inadvertently) change the form or meaning of the post, essentially putting words in the author's mouth.\n\nIn my opinion, anyone that can may edit any post for any reason, but if the owner of the post reverts the changes, immediately drop the issue. If a post owner does not like the changes made to a post, why force it upon them with an edit war? If a post is unclear it won't be answered or voted up. If it contains offensive content, it will be removed as such. A possible exception to this rule can be allowed for Community Wiki posts, as the ownership of such posts is, by design, much looser than that of regular posts.\n\nDoes this sound doable?"}, {"author_name": "nobody", "gravatar_hash": "325e29323813381fff4f0ed5c986c98b", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 05, 2009", "message": "I should clarify a bit about my last post - I still have all my fingers (thankfully!).

I believe I improved the clarity of the title significantly and that I also improved the clarity of the body of the post.  I also made a few formatting improvements that don't show in the edit history at all.\n\nYes, I also removed the \"Hi,\" when I did so.  The OP edited the post after my edit, only changing the case of a character in the title.  (I've seen everyone refer to the language as \"r\" so that's what I used.  The author, as a user of this language, gets final say and gets to call it \"R\".)  If the OP was upset about the edits, he or she said nothing.  I believe that by improving the question title and by improving the readability of the content, I was directly helping both the OP and future people with a similar problem.\n\nAnd why would you ever revert *any* minor edit to which the OP did not object?  As much as you suggest RichB is on a crusade, if you are going through his edit history so that you can revert his edits that you object to, you are doing what you are accusing him of doing.\n\nWhat is your opinion of my edit in http://stackoverflow.com/revisions/612258/list where I corrected the grammar of the title?

I would try to communicate via comment with the author, or if their revert comment specified what they objected to, I would probably re-edit without the \"offensive\" part of the edit. Incremental improvement is better than no improvement. While someone who objects in an absolute sense to having their posts edited by other people probably doesn't belong on SO, it's not my job to police that.  After a few attempts at communication, I would drop it.\n\nAlso, yes, I heartily agree that some forum area for these sorts of communication and meta-conversation is essential.  It would take a *lot* of noise off of SO, where it doesn't belong, and it would reduce the noise on UV.  At a minimum, we need something that serves the same purpose as the \"discuss\" or \"talk\" pages on Wikipedia.

That this happens time and time again on the Internet makes me wonder if we are subconsciously railing against the homogenizing effect of a universal medium.  *contemplative stroking of chin*\n\nWith that said, let me take a moment to be anti-homogenization.  On the practical front, I think merely removing salutations isn't going far enough.  I believe a brief overview of the question ought to be the first thing in order to improve the previews in listings.  Take, for example, this one: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/618570/problem-with-tab-selecting-in-jquery  In that example, the preview on listing is \"Hello all, (sorry for the seccond post, something went wrong in the first one!) I have the following problem: I want to create a webpage in which I can use the JQuey tabs both b \u2026 \"  This provides almost no information about the question.  What good, then, is the preview?\n\nI'm also opposed to salutations on a more stylistic level.  They strike me as terribly sophomoric; they remind me of the way my wife's 8th grade students write essays.  \"Hi!  My name is X and I have a problem.  Here is my problem: .  Thanks for your help!  Your friend, X\"  That's an awful signal-to-noise ratio when compared to \"\".  Granted, I'm not a machine and I fully capable of ignoring all that cruft.  But by the same token, shouldn't all of you be just as capable of assuming that the question-asker is appreciative of your help and that (s)he wishes you a good day if all that cruft is taken away?\n\nAt the end of the day, I really don't care either way.  My life will be no better or worse regardless of the outcome.  But if we're breaking out our opinions and complaints, then you'd better believe I'm on board.

Loss of edit priv for 1 day?) *anyone* who is not the OP who causes a rollback/edit cooldown period by doing *many* (not just one) edits/rollbacks.
