Sometimes (oftentimes?) it's difficult to formulate a question using the terminology appropriate for a particular realm of knowledge, especially if you're unfamiliar with that realm. Additionally, consider that if you're unfamiliar with that realm, you're more likely to ask a question about it.\n\nFor example, take my recent question on redirection in Django: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/798604/. Had I known what I was looking for was called \"redirection\" I would have been able to JFGI. The problem is while I knew what I wanted to do, I couldn't identify the right terminology to find it by a search. That's where humans excel over computers: they can understand semantics of my question and place it in the correct vocabulary. In other words, the newbie says, \"I want to do foo,\" and the guru says, \"That's called doing bar.\"\n\nThe proper response to a case like this is indeed just saying, \"You're looking for this; here is a link to the docs, a similar questions page on Wikipedia, etc.\" This seems to be what's happening on SO.

Then voting begins.\n\n  2) If it can be argued that the question is sufficiently different from the one posted, a comment is posted describing the differences. If the duplicate link was edited into the post, the edit can be rolled back, or moved into a \"see also\" section at the bottom of the post. Note that when multiple duplicates or near-duplicates have been found, the subtle differences argument is unlikely to fly - chances are, answers to existing questions more than adequately cover this new scenario even if it was not explicitly asked previously.\n\n  3) Once 5 people have voted to close as \"Exact Duplicate\", etiquette demands that a link be preserved in the question, even if there is still some disagreement as to whether or not it is truly an exact duplicate. If a sufficient number of people feel that the new question can stand on its own, then they can vote to re-open it.\n\nAt any point in this process, both the new and old questions may be edited, either to make the original more general (in cases where good general-purpose answers were provided for an unnecessarily specific question) or to make the new question more specific (and thus less likely to fall under the scope of the old question). \n\n---\n\nNote that this process depends heavily on there being a period of time post-closure for the resolution of disputes, although such disputes are relatively rare. \n\nNote the importance of providing a duplicate link and visible indicator on the post up-front. Not only does this avoid leaving the person asking the question hanging while he sees close votes accumulate on his question, but also helps prevent wasting the time of people who might otherwise provide answers that mirror those already given for the original question.\n\nFinally, note that many questions are duplicates of multiple previous questions."}, {"author_name": "Jeff Atwood", "gravatar_hash": "51d623f33f8b83095db84ff35e15dbe8", "author_url": "http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/", "date": "Apr 29, 2009", "message": "to see our current question 404 page, try this\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/99999999/no-this-question-doesnt-exist\n\nNote that google and local search are one click."}, {"author_name": "Shog9", "gravatar_hash": "ae15c48f686a0ecb39848f980b296611", "author_url": "http://www.shog9.com/", "date": "Apr 29, 2009", "message": "y'know what's better than one click...?"}, {"author_name": "Shog9", "gravatar_hash": "ae15c48f686a0ecb39848f980b296611", "author_url": "http://www.shog9.com/", "date": "Apr 29, 2009", "message": "Actually, if the titles are sufficiently different then the 404 search links may be effectively useless.

But you need to notify the user somehow to give both a carrot and a stick. Just whacking the redundant cut-and-paste dupes may encourage more aggressive duplicating.\n\nFor accidental duplicates (category 2), IMO, doing a 301 redirect is the better solution here, at least for a time.  Question:  What happens to votes (and *and* down) applied to the duplicate question?  Will this be considered \"deleted\" or a new kind of invisible?  Will 10k users still see it?\n\nThere are also accidental duplicates of a category you didn't mention:  Questions where a human being can easily tell it's a duplicate, but it asks the exact same question in a way significantly differently from the original, using different words and different terms.  We may wish to handle this differently.  When the questions are asked differently enough, there's clear value to leaving both questions on the site and merging the answer sets.  (As \"nobody\" says above and as I suggested at http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/how-many-questions-are-closed-or-deleted/#comment-20309 earlier.)\n\nFor borderline duplicates, links to \"see also\" at the bottom of the question are useful.  At some point this becomes a matter of judgment.\n\nRegarding finding duplicates, I think we need a voting system where votes can be taken back.  I've voted to close as duplicate and later seen a comment that make it clear the question wasn't a true duplicate.  But I couldn't undo my vote to close as duplicate.\n\nI think we need a separate system for handling duplicates.
