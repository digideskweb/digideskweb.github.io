The current policy applies a negative selection pressure on such users by not allowing them to discuss the very same system in which they spend long hours every week. Instead of frustrating those who care the most about SO, let them Q&amp;A on its issues. That's the natural thing to do, and that's exactly what newcomers usually do - ask a question about SO itself (only to be shut down promptly and banished to some bug system where they have to re-login, figure out how to use it, and find out that it's a lame system).\n\nClosing doesn't say \\this question needs RADICAL changes\\. You might want closing to say that, but it doesn't. In reality closing communicates the following sentiment: \\SHUT UP WITH THAT\\. But I guess those who make the rules tend not to get questions they ask closed so I understand why they might make this mistake.\n\nClosing also has the effect of delaying a question long enough so it has less chances of being answered. So a question that was closed and reopened has much less chances of being answered than a question that was never closed. That's just one of the side effects of closing, and that's one of the reasons why we should be more careful with closing.\n\nMaybe part of the problem is that the different reasons for closing a question all translate into the same question life-cycle. Thus questions that are arguably soft or perhaps a bit theoretical or puzzle questions are dealt with the same way as utter spam and trolling is dealt with. \n\nSo maybe there should be a softer way of marking questions for review or improvement beside closing. E.g. when reopening questions, send them back to the top of the \\newest\\ pile. So instead of the OP having to fight (basically over a half-dead question) to be reopened, he would have the chance of getting his question improved/reopened and Then \\rentered\\ into the system where it would stand a fair chance of actually being answered."}, {"author_name": "Assaf", "gravatar_hash": "d01891f2b521660ac24839d6473d1d8f", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 23, 2009", "message": "p.s. another example why blog comments are insufficient for discussing SO is the above comment (by me) which was garbled by twice-failed annoying recaptcha tests. quotes turned into backslashes and naturally no way of editing the comment or seeing how many people agree with it. \n\np.p.s.\nOh fun, now another turing test to post this comment..."}, {"author_name": "Jess Sightler", "gravatar_hash": "eac4001b8c054ee994480f0a6e2cdcf8", "author_url": "http://www.jroller.com/jsight/", "date": "Apr 23, 2009", "message": "&gt; Closing doesn\u2019t say \\this question needs RADICAL \n&gt; changes\\.

Lovely, lovely numbers!  1 in 50 seems too high. My subjective observation is that actually less than 1 in several hundred questions are controversially closed.

So it's reasonable to argue that the number of grey-area questions is not worth the amount of discussion we have here (and elsewhere) about them.\n\nBut I think putting the numbers in the context of good questions is a mistake.  An analogous situation is cell-phone dropped calls.  Phone companies are probably quite proud of their statistics which show only 1 in X calls are dropped.  From an engineering standpoint, its amazing and getting better.\n\nBut if you are the one who's call is dropped, you're not happy.  And if you happen to live or work in a location that is subject to lots of dropped calls, you are going to be a very disgruntled customer.

And putting them through a tortuous cycle of editing, commenting, reopening and reclosing may be the most degenerate result.

Remember that some of that 2% is duplicates, meaning a *smaller* fraction is stuff closed for \"belongs on uservoice\" or \"off topic\" or \"not a question.\"\n\nI keep being surprised to see people advocating a system with no rules (other than \"no SPAM\"). I agree with the several who have pointed out that the fact that so many questions get closed shapes behavior and causes people to avoid asking the kind of question that will get closed.  The moment you say, \"Anything goes except SPAM,\" the number of off-topic questions will skyrocket.\n\nTo me, 1/50 questions being closed as off-topic or duplicate is too high.  To me, that says there are too questions that fall into the bucket: \"duplicate, off topic, or on the fence.\"\n\nFor a site like /. it makes sense to gain rep bring being clever or funny, but for a computer QA site, gaining rep for being funny seems, well, funny.  I am less apt to vote to close an off-topic question that is CW, but most off-topic questions are not CW.  And there are some who advocate to NEVER mark questions CW!\n\nMaybe a consensus about off-topic posts, polls, and the like being CW will help?  Some who vote to close a non-CW post would leave it open if it were CW. Others will vote to close anyway, but a consensus about CW posts might change that.\n\nTo sum it up and ignoring the \"close and delete nothing but SPAM\" folks, I see the community struggling over these issues:\n\n1) Meta questions on SO, most of which are a poorer fit for UV than for SO.  We need an appropriate place for meta discussion.  This blog is a lot better than nothing, but not sufficient for the demand that is out there.\n\n2) Soft questions and not-off-topic-but-on-the-fence questions -- maybe a consensus on CW would help here.  If there were a consensus, people might be less quick to vote to close something as long as it was CW.\n\n3) Duplicates -- we need a way to merge duplicates, but this is a hard problem.  One way, maybe, of handling duplicates would be to merge the answer sets so the multiple duplicates have the same set of answers.  That is, you answer one and the answer appears on all.  Of course, the community would need to create the \"duplicate\" linkages.\n\n4) Poorly worded questions.  Note that editing a poorly worded question promotes it to the front page again.

I think the system could be altered to avoid closing questions, but I know it ain't gonna happen.  So I tried to indicate I was resigned to our current system and am not pushing to change it.\n\n&gt; How so? I think voting is an entirely different axis of expression. Closing is an EDITORIAL function. Voting is a POPULIST function. Both groups are necessary.\n\nNow this is an important insight.  In fact it gets at something that has bothered me for a very long time about Stack Overflow that I just now understand.  You want us to enforce your rules.\n\nThe small number of founders make a set of rules about what belongs and what doesn't.  (No meta-questions is one such rule.)  Then the larger subset of users who have enough reputation are asked to enforce the rules.  So the populist group is being asked to perform an editorial function.  It's as if the executive makes the rules and the legislature enforces them.  You can see why this seems unnatural to a US citizen at the very least.\n\nToday you are saying that we are free to enforce the rules the way we feel like.  But we all know that ultimately, you have any power over Stack Overflow that you feel like granting yourself.  When you look at the vast majority of high-reputation users, they agree with the rules you've laid out.  So anyone who takes time to disagree is beating at the wind.  It's a complete waste of time if your goal is to change the situation.\n\nI admire you for listening to dissenters as much as you have.  Far too many people would not do what you've done.  But as nice as it is to be given an opportunity to disagree, it's not really a level playing field.  This is why high-reputation users *need* a space for meta-discussion no matter how evil it might be.\n\nTo get back to the main point, remember that we are talking about fringe questions.  That's what the statistics represent.  The majority of questions are easy: either they are in or they are out.  That's the easy part of editing.  These grey-area questions are difficult.  Probably too difficult for anyone who doesn't have a full picture of the situation and are experts both on the rules and how they have been enforced in the past.  In the US, there's a final set of checks and balances designed to answer these sort of edge cases: the courts.  As far as I know, Stack Overflow does not have that branch.\n\nI'm very hesitant to even mention that because it's likely to be difficult or impossible to retrofit the community at this point.  I know that if I had my way, Stack Overflow would instantly lose some of its best contributors.  Radically changing things at this point is a bit like killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.\n\nBy the way, I think if you are going to have closed questions, you should not allow them to be reopened  The decision ought to be decisive and final.
