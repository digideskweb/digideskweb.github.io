It seems from your\ncomments that you do not intend the alternate meaning of if there is\nonly one mistake, don't fix it.\n\nIf my understanding is correct, I agree with that. I also add, however,\nthat even fixing a single error of many improves the site, and while\nit'd certainly be better to fix all of them, fixing one is still a\npositive contribution.\n\nI certainly welcome any such edits to my posts, no matter how trivial.\n\nI agree with other posters that removing leading fluff is significantly\nhelpful, as it improves the question \"preview\" text; further, I believe\nthat removing fluff anywhere is good. I believe that in general copy\nediting is helpful, as it makes the questions and answers easier to\nread. However, I temper these beliefs with another, that ultimately the\nOP \u201cowns\u201d his question, and that if he does not want copy editing \u2014\nindicated by him reverting \u2014 then it should not be provided.\n\nJeff, I also suggest looking to Wikipedia for inspiration; they have\ndealt with this issue for ages. For example, their three-revert rule\n(3RR) helps prevent this kind of edit warring.\n\n--\n\n@Click Upvote, Rich B, Samuel\n\nI am an uninvolved third party who knows none of you, and none of your\npast disputes (if any). I hope thus to provide the view of an impartial\nthird party.\n\n408929 is an edit war, and its not something any of you should be proud\nof. I suggest you all start following something akin to Wikipedia's 3RR\nto prevent future incidents.\n\nIn particular:\n\n1. I agree that the community owns the tags, and that tvanfosson (who\n   did not edit war) made a proper edit to put in the subjective tag.\n   There are plenty of community members who prefer to ignore subjective\n   questions, and the subjective tag provides a technical mechanism to\n   do so.\n\n2. I really have no opinion about the 'general-programming' tag. I wish\n   there weren't a five-tag limitation, but as there is, I can\n   understand it being removed to make room for subjective.\n\n3. Gortok (who did not edit war) made a useful contribution. I do not\n   believe anyone disputes this.\n\n4. Samuel's changing \"Pros\" and \"Cons\" to lowercase is, by standard\n   English, correct. To me, that is a helpful edit. However, the edit\n   warring afterwards was certainly not.\n\n5. I do not understand Click Upvote's revert of the lowercasing; it\n   really looks like it wasn't performed in good faith to me. However,\n   it is his question, so, I'm not sure about this. Personally, were\n   that my edit being reverted, I would not have edited the question\n   again.\n\n6. The edit war of capitalize/uncapitalize is plain silly.

The same is true for the answers.  While I've gotten used to the WIKI nature of Stackoverflow, there is certainly a perception about the types of edits that are being made.\n\nFixing typos is and adding information to the question that will help it get answered are one thing, but consitently going into questions asked and rewording them along with other non-value added changes will upset people.  Afterall, their name is what is shown in the corner.\n\nAt the end of the day, StackOverflow is by far the best place to come for technical issues and I'm on here almost everyday.  The very nature of the site and ownership of questions and answers is what fuels the edit and rollback wars.  \n\nIf we can't be adults, then all of this is for not.  While I know there are some who think that they have done no wrong, we all must remember it takes 2 to tango.  These edit and rollback wars have multiple parties. \n\nMy reccommendation is pretty simple, if an edit is rolled back, just leave it alone.  You tried to help, but clearly it wasn't desired.  The person who asked the question will have to live with the answers they receive along with the up/down votes.\n\nIf you have a question or answer that gets edited, just try to ask yourself if the change made improves the overall utility of the thread or not.\n\nAgain, this entire thread and all of the efforts by Jeff and team will be completely wasted if we can't be adults.  The notion of not being a \"jerk\" is important.  If multiple people around you are suggesting you are acting like a \"jerk\", maybe you should evaluate what they are seeing from their side, not your own."}, {"author_name": "tvanfosson", "gravatar_hash": "fb599bac7c1f602a2ea455951d6da209", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 10, 2009", "message": "I came across the perfect exception to the rule today on SO.

It's simply not worth risking a conflict over.\n\nEvery time you make an edit, keep in mind that the person whose post you're editing may disagree. He may find it rude that you fix his typos, or he may disagree with your interpretation/clarification of the question.\n\nIf I post a question, I have a kind of ownership over it. It's my name that is shown next to it, and whatever the question says, is associated with me.\nThat is unlike Wikipedia, where there is no clear ownership of individual pages. Anyone can edit, because no one \"owns\" the page.\n\nOn SO, it's a bit different. Feel free to edit, but respect the owner. And respect that he may feel differently about small nitpicky edits than you do.\n\nSo don't edit unless you think it is worth risking that conflict. \n\nAnd that means that no, I have to disagree with Rich B. I agree with a lot of the stuff about \"making good edits\", of course, but ultimately, I feel that if person X asks a question on SO, then person X has the final say on what's in that question. Even if that means the question becomes unreadable and downvoted. Even if it means that helpful and well-intentioned edits get rolled back. Tough luck, but that was apparently what the person asking it wanted.\n\nEdits should not be anonymous. Stand by your edits, and accept that you are editing someone else's text, and you can't hide behind their name, because your name will be put on the question too.\n\nFinally, I fundamentally disagree with your apparent view of SO as a \"moderator\"-driven site.\nBack when Jeff asked for nominees for moderator, that was a big issue, because in your mind (and others. I'm not trying to make this into a \"the world vs Rich B\" post), moderators are important. In the previous post, it was a big issue that SO \"isn't a democracy\". It seems like you have the idea that there is, or should/must be some ruling clique who *controls* SO. Whether that is Jeff, a group of moderators, a \"democracy\" within the community or \"a gentleman agreement\" among the readers of this blog, it is implicit that any disagreement goes to this ruling clique. If I disagree with how you edited my post, I shouldn't just revert it, I should \"take it up with the moderators\". And if someone higher up in the hierarchy edits my post, they get priority so I shouldn't rollback.\n\nI think that's missing the point of the site. I don't need to take it up with the moderators, because I have the power to edit my own post. SO isn't a community, and the need for rulers or moderators is minimal. Posting on SO doesn't place me anywhere in a community or hierarchy, not as moderator, and not as newbie, and not anywhere in between. The ultimate authority in disputes about question X is the author of question X. That is who you have to appeal to if you disagree with an edit or rollback of same.\nPart of what makes SO so useful is that there are no ranks, no one you have to ask permission, and no one to overrule you (except of course in extreme cases of clearly offensive questions or spam)\n\nIf I ask a question, then within that question no one outranks me. I can accept edits, but I can sure as hell also revert them. So like Russ said above, if an edit is rolled back, leave it. The questioner didn't want your help, so leave it alone. They're the ones who'll get downvoted if the question sucks anyway.\n\nAt least, that's how I see SO.

I have been to date, purely a reader of SO and have been highly impressed with what Jeff, his team and the community have achieved. SO has become a vibrant community, and already contains a wealth of knowledge, which is rapidly evolving into a centralised repository. SO is also something to which I will contribute to, from my own specialised fields of work and study ... in due course. However, discussions such as this make me shake my head and question why?\n\nAgree to disagree, but at least properly justify and clarify your respective positions. Propose solutions, and not fuel arguments about minutia.\n\nIf you care to listen to a person with no SO ranking or badges and no interest to gain any, this is my opinion:\n\nDecide on the factors required for editing:\n\n1). Accountability (anonymous is evil)\n2). Responsibility (degree of earned trust)\n3). Justification (require a reason)\n4). Intelligibility (improve the question)\n5). Presentability (grammar Nazis, etc.)\n6). Comprehension (clearer direction to solution)\n7). Moderation (ownership of the question)\n\nThe question asked has a name attached, and that name alone possess the right to be viewed and read in the language and style of their choosing - errors, flaws and all. They are the ones who asked it. Without them, it would not exist. The question should be treated as if it has an automatic copyright applied. (Cue the copyright activists ... who haven't a clue what I'm actually implying)\n\nModeration rights therefore belong to the original question owner - not to anyone with editing rights. Because of this perceived right of the morally justified few, some questions have been greatly modified, and then ask entirely different questions, thereby diverging from the original authors intention.\n\nRequire a justification on all edits, as this provides a built-in and already available forum for discussion, tracking and abuse moderation.\n\nRules can be put into place regarding any perceived issues (delayed edit visibility, time limits before auto-approval, \"grand-high exalted poo-bah editor badges\", etc.) \n\nFinal say is the right of the original question owner.\n\nSince all edits are tracked, the edited portions of questions could quite readily be (subtly) highlighted on the site (black vs. grey for example). This then (optionally) indicates how a question has been modified, and/or diverged from its original form.\n\nTo this end, having the original question available and moderated by the asker, is the only way to understand the original intent in the case of any edit wars.\n\n---\n\nWhat is a SO ranking truly worth? I've got a perfect 0.\n\nFix it, don't break it.\n\nEdit wars are just self-deluded egotistical morally bankrupt pissing contests.\n\nMine is bigger than yours in any case.\n\n(Cue the trolls ...)"}, {"author_name": "Eddie", "gravatar_hash": "3d184a8ef609eaabcaabd0dd19196a74", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 12, 2009", "message": "@tvanfosson: The funny thing about your post is the very day you posted that, I edited a post with the same error. \n\n@bear-in-the-woods and @jalf: I believe that editing for grammar and readability does a large service.
