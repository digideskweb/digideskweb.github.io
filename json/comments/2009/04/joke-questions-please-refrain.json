You can't vote to reopen or cancel close votes until it is closed.  The people who seem to have lots of time to spend on SO seem to like to close things.  I am a proponent of just leaving things open - unless it is spam or offensive.  Jeff CLAIMS that the site is to be run by the users, but he then releases edicts and gets involved in particular questions.  It is inconsistent that he wants to have it both ways - fun and intolerant of marginal questions.  Oh well.  It is his site, but I am not fooled by his claims that he is letting the users pick the questions that remain."}, {"author_name": "Mike", "gravatar_hash": "9c44d512c30bd79bd0658a7d4e2a0b44", "author_url": "http://google.com", "date": "May 01, 2009", "message": "your site is GREAT, its one of the best sites I have ever seen on the internet, surfing up by more than 3 years!
