The architecture of a program involves more than just the user interface (in the case of a kernel, the API/ABI); in the case of the Linux kernel there is a significant \"architecture\" which is apparent to anyone who looks at the code.  Many high level design decisions represent the architecture, such as the filesystem layer (VFS) which allows you to plug in filesystem drivers.  Implementing a filesystem is a job for a programmer; designing the VFS is the job for the architect.  Joel is partially right in that some of the requirements for the VFS were derived from Minix (or more accurately Posix), but Linus didn't recreate Minix.  Example of an architecture decision: using a microkernel or a monolithic kernel.  Linus made all the early architecture decisions (since he was the only developer).  As new developers came along some of them also made architectural decisions, and now there are many people who fulfill the role.\n\nRemember: there is a difference between a role and the person who does that role.  And the architecture role (high level design, technology choices, etc) is a real role.  Every project has someone making these decisions.  Some teams have people who only make these kinds of decisions; they are \"architects\".  Many of those people lose sight of reality because they are in an architect-distortion-field.

What CNProg has done is wrong because it's wrong to pass someone else's work as one's own, not because there are a bunch of programmers who aren't fluent in English. The fact that the theft doesn't help with making the world respect China more probably means more to the CNProg people than their compatriots' lack of English proficiency.  \n\nGiven how people are taught there and the absence of a general grasp of the idea of \"plagiarism,\" you probably have to first explain to them what plagiarism is and why it is bad and how they're doing a great job earning Chinese programmers a bad name. This may sound weird, but in an education system that emphasizes rote learning above all else, copying the work of people better than you to the point of being able to memorize and reproduce exactly is often seen as an intellectual virtue. \n\nWhile it's true that because of America's status as the leader in computer science and various other factors that English has been the lingua franca of programming and of the internet, it's not true that you must know English to be a good programmer. I know an elite programmer with a 200 I.Q. in his early 40s who simply can't cope with English. The ability to learn a new natural language is not the same as the ability to learn a new coding language, if only because natural languages are so much messier and richer than computer codes. Try and learn Chinese or Japanese while living in the US full time and see how far you can go in four years. Given how different these two languages are from English, you won't go very far, I guarantee you. ;)\n\nBeing able to read English programming book also is not the same as being able to pose a question properly in English; you can guess what it means without really understanding the grammar in the former case, but to actually \"produce\" something yourself you do need to know the language. I have a friend who has translated several O'Reilly books yet can't even write a simple present tense sentence correctly. This means that there are probably a bunch of StackOverflow readers who use the site regularly but are unable to really \"use\" it when they need a question answered because they are afraid of making a fool of themselves publicly with lousy English.\n\nJust try not to mix these two things together.

Admitting that you've been learning something for over a decade yet doesn't really know it hurts. And my guess is the people you talk to usually have done very well in school and got very good marks on their school English exams, which makes that admittance so much more hurtful to their pride. \n\n2) There's usually a lot of prestige attached to knowing the language of the most powerful nation in the world. This doesn't mean that non-English speakers outside the US have inferiority complex regarding their own language. It just means that they get a higher place on the local social hierarchy if they are good at English.

Because none of us is good at UI design, and when we follow the original system functions, we keep all UI styles all the time. From early of March, I began to build new interface for beta2, but before cnprog has been discovered by western world, it hadn't been finished yet and CNProg was still in beta1 testing within limited friends. \n\nDuring the whole event of copying SO thing, we have kept silence all the time. Because I don't care western people call me \"thief\", as long as through cnprog, we do give a new opportunity to help Chinese developers. Our serving users are Chinese. But don't get me wrong, I do have regrets from this, and the only one is I feel sorry to make people get confused between SO and cnprog. And the same time, I do think there is gap between western and eastern world-languages, cultures, and the variance from this podcast is one of the best proves. So I didn't say anything when I saw many critical comments and unreasonable tease, but did our best to update whole website with new UI ASAP.\n\nBut now, more western people are considering we are evil to bring cnprog up, and they think the existence of cnprog is a shame for Chinese developers. And even worse, some Chinese developers without any observation, they begin to believe all these negative judgement. That's the worst thing for us and cnprog, maybe it's ok for me without your respect but cnprog needs. There needs somebody stand up and let others know. Otherwise, we'd rather to stop and stay away.

Whether it's joining open source projects, enjoying the full breadth of documentation, getting your questions answered on SO, etc.. all of this requires English for <i>programmers</i>.\n\nAs I said above:\n\n> Part of the explicit goal of Stack Overflow is for programmers to learn to be better communicators \u2014 better communicators in English, the lingua franca of programming.\n\n> It\u2019s sort of like <b>arguing that there should be a special Stack Overflow for Perl, or Stack Overflow for Haskell</b>.. it\u2019s kind of .. totally missing the point on a certain level."}, {"author_name": "Pop Catalin", "gravatar_hash": "6905efdf12e66dd9a3b94e6aa4d01cac", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 13, 2009", "message": "&gt; Part of the explicit goal of Stack Overflow is for programmers to learn to be better communicators \u2014 better communicators in English, the lingua franca of programming.\n\nThat won't happen for countries that don't have think the same way you do. Even if (we) the rest of the world share your opinion, in the countries mentioned there's a strong tradition to use the native language for anything computer related. The french don't even use English words for technical terms, they have their own terms  \"software\" -&gt; \"logiciel\", even if the rest of the world has imported the word \"software\" directly.\n\n&gt; I\u2019m curious what\u2019s the percentage of French, Spanish, German, Chinese and Japanese programmers on stackoverflow?\n\n\nOk, maybe asking for numbers is too much, but can you say that SO has roughly the same audience of French, German and Spanish programmers, like it has for other countries?"}, {"author_name": "Peter", "gravatar_hash": "745edd0ed5ca0851d9134bff34dd6588", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 13, 2009", "message": "Jeff, I think you're trapped in an echo chamber. Of course if you ask people who read you blog -- written in English -- about English they're going to be biased. I'm not saying you are totally wrong, but the data you're working with is not representative. There's a whole world, literally, out there that you don't really have access to without knowing that specific language. I don't think you can accurately judge the size and impact of the Chinese market without being part of it or at least knowing the language. While SO has 50K+ members that's still small compared to the millions of programmers out there.\n\nWe appreciate all your hard work, and I understand how localizing the site would be a huge task. If you don't feel like it's worth it or don't have the time / energy / desire to tackle the problem, that's fine too.\n\nI think where things got heated is when you claimed your superiority, or the superiority of the language you use, and labeling everybody else as second tier. When you do this, you anger a big portion of your audience. I personally have no problem writing / reading in English, but I have friends who I know that struggle with the language, and when you label them one way or another simply because their \"language gene\" is not the best it leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth.

One hurdle separates those of us arguing for it and (basically) Jeff.  If the goal is to provide a forum for every programmer to hone their craft, share knowledge and communicate effectively, it's necessary for a common language to be used.  \n\nJeff's model is the lingua franca model: pick a language and stick to it.  If you don't know the language, you must learn it or be handicapped.  It's a reasonable model and many industries use it.  For instance, if you want to be a pilot, you need to know enough English to communicate with air-traffic control.  It's a hard requirement.\n\nOne alternative model is what might be called the marketplace model.  Rather than picking a common language upfront, the parties to each transaction negotiate a language to bargain in.  When we visited Italy a few years ago, my wife and I went to some outdoor markets.  Some vendors spoke English, but others did not.  In those cases, we either: a) moved on, b) tried Spanish, or c) used ad hoc sign language.  It wasn't ideal, but we didn't have time to learn Italian and couldn't expect everyone else to learn English.\n\n(It seems obvious to me that Stack Overflow is well suited to the marketplace model, but the transition would not be easy or painless.  If the development team is not committed to the model, it will be far too much to take on.)\n\nI believe Jeff chose the lingua franca model for ideological reasons, just as he chose to use OpenID.  One would hope that if some other language replaced English, Stack Overflow would also change languages.  There is an added practical reason: Jeff and his team speak English.\n\nThe reason I think Jeff's comment above works *for* localizing rather than against it is that I believe the marketplace model works better to achieve the goal of a common language than the lingua franca model.  Trying to enforce a common language results in silos that refuse to interact with each other.  Counter-intuitively, creating a language-neutral marketplace will result in a small number of languages that participants will want to know in order to reach the largest number of counter-parties.  For programming, English is likely to be the overwhelming favorite.\n\nAssuming Stack Overflow does not localize, there will be similar sites in other languages.  To the degree they connect questioners to answerers in their silo, they will be successful.  But there will never be an easy transition from one silo to another.  Tragically, Stack Overflow will lose the opportunity to be a language-neutral (mostly English) marketplace."}, {"author_name": "Ashwin Nanjappa", "gravatar_hash": "e656e8a79ae5a416f0c3d4de38d302b1", "author_url": "http://ashwin.zaatar.org/", "date": "Apr 13, 2009", "message": "@Jon Ericson: That was a very erudite comment, thanks!
