The problem here is that localizing Stack Overflow may be a little more complex than it would immediately look. It would not be enough to simply translate the website. You would also have to monitor the website for people \"taking over\" questions written in another language.\n\nGoogle learned that the hard way with Orkut. Brazilians quickly took over the site, making it very hard for other people to use it. Imagine a questions asked in English with Brazilians answering in Portuguese and starting all these discussions.

Of course, I'm only using Brazilians as an example here.\n\nGoogle eventually caught up and made changes to Orkut to make it easier to experience it in only one language while ignoring the rest, but it was too late and Orkut became essentially a Brazilian site.\n\nStack Overflow is very good as it is right now (English-only) and although I can see Joel's point that there are more markets out there, I think right now SO should focus on what it does best.\n\nJust my 2\u00a2"}, {"author_name": "jalf", "gravatar_hash": "5794f28dc1aba7a8844933816a6fa2c9", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 16, 2009", "message": "Re: localization, the question of \"should StackOverflow cover all languages\", that's just a business question. Would the added traffic outweigh the added development/maintenance costs? If yes, localize, if not, don't.\n\nAs for which language people actually use, it's trickier. As Jon said, it takes a certain level of English fluency to be able to talk about code in English. You only need to know a few words to be able to write your code in more or less English, but to explain it, or ask questions about it, you need to be a lot better.\n\nOn the other hand, the opposite can be true as well. Once that level of English fluency is reached, using English can be preferable, simply because it always becomes awkward when you mix languages. Having to slow down a bit, and occasionally google a word may be preferable to trying to juggle two languages, and constantly alternate between the two, and trying to do so consistently (For the podcast's example of CreateWindow, it gets *really* confusing if the description starts talking about \"Window\" in non-English, requiring the reader to mentally do the translation and mapping to the technical concept.\nI long ago gave up on writing about programming in my own language. It just becomes an impossible mess of localized vs nonlocalized technical terms, attempts to use the grammatical rules of one language for technical terms taken from another, and not least, different translations than others may use. That's the reason I hate and despise localized IDE's. What is the correct translation of \"compile\", for example? I can think of four or five candidates in Danish. Will the localized application use the one I'm thinking of? Will they use the same one consistently? Is the translator enough of a programmer to know what \"compile\" actually means in a programming context? Will I be able to *recognize that their translation means \"compile\"?\nAll too often, the answer is \"no\".\n\nIn that sense, I think English is the de facto language of programming. If you know it, you almost certainly prefer to use it consistently, *even* if you still have another language you're better at. \n\nIf you don't know English, obviously using it is not an option.\n\nSo I don't think people prefer to speak \"their own language\", but rather there's a threshold where you flip over from \"my native language\" to \"English\".\n\nI see quite a bit of imperfect English here, since people aren't native speakers. But people still prefer communicating about programming in English And of course, the reason for this is that people here are generally *good enough* at English that the occasional broken sentence isn't a deal-breaker. There is no doubt that if the English skill drops too low, the native language becomes preferable. But the threshold is not \"equal skill in both\". Imperfect english is preferable to most people over perfect non-english.\n\nIn some parts of the world, English clearly isn't even an option.\n\nAs for being impressed that all of MSDN is human translated to Japanese, I think I'm more shocked by the proposition that other languages may have been machine-translated. Doing that just shows a staggering disregard for localization and for making your content understandable. It is often better to make no translation at all, than to rely on machine translation.\n\nAs for Steam, as people have already mentioned, most of the big companies use it now. EA and Ubisoft came to Steam a few months ago, THQ and many others have been there for a long time. Sega has games there.\nEven store-bought games are starting to be tied to Steam. The last two games I bought (Dawn of War 2 and Empire: Total War) were bought as boxed copies - but both have to be activated on Steam before I can play them.
