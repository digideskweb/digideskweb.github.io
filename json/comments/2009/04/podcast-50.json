(I still think you're keeping a good story from us, though)\n\n&gt; Steve observes that the only way to determine what packages are installed on Ubuntu is to diff the dpackage output against a clean machine.\n\nJust to be clear, I think what Steve Yegge meant is that the only way to determine what packages that have been installed on the system since installation is to diff the 'dpkg -l' output. This is probably true, but just listing all the installed packages is trivial: 'dpkg -l | grep ^i' or 'aptitude search ~i' does just fine.\n\nThe real trouble is the shifting boundary of an open source operating system: where does the operating system end and the user applications begin? If that distinction is unclear, there's no good way of telling what's not native to the system.\n\nThat question could be clear though, if package managers would just install user specified packages to a completely different directory hierarchy than those specified by the distribution. Then Linux distro release versions could actually mean something."}, {"author_name": "theman", "gravatar_hash": "40ae6a389169b134c62fc18970be740c", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 23, 2009", "message": "congrats on 50 episodes!!
