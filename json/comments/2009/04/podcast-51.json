I could not get the feature to work the way I expected.  Since I was right already here, I searched for the question about the stackoverflow.com feature.  There were several answers but they needed clarification (which I figured out after 15min of messing with uservoice).  I updated it with a new answer and helped someone else who later up-voted my answer. Bam! Instant documentation.
