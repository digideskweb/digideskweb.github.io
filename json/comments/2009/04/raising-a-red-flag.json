Since offensive flags are anonymous (as they should be) there's not much sense in getting angry at the flagger.\n\nThis does bring up another point - these flags (offensive/spam/open/close) should be reversible. If I've voted to close or marked as offensive a post that later is radically improved, I would like the ability to remove my vote. With regard to open/close, I think that it would also be beneficial to be able to vote a question to stay open or to stay closed. As it is, a controversial post will oscillate between open and closed as both sides have their say. This is frustrating for all parties involved, but none more so than those that are trying to answer the post only to find it closed when they click \"Post Your Answer\". IIRC, those that typed up an answer when the question was still open used to be able to post that answer after the question was closed. However, a new \"feature\" came along that would repeatedly poll the question to check for new answers but also to check to see if the question was already closed.

And no point to seeing them at all. You really should be getting better feedback from comments, edits, etc. anyway, so a flag count just becomes a distraction.\n\nAs for being reversible... Originally, just about every action you could do on the site was effectively reversible: posts could be deleted, comments could be removed, votes could be retracted, closed posts could be re-opened, edits could be rolled back... Flagging was the exception: you flag a post when there's nothing you can do about it, and let the system sort it out. I don't think it was ever intended to be viewed as a concrete action... but, that's how it was implemented.\n\nThen that started to fall apart. Closing was turned into another voting system, with no way to retract a vote. Post deletion was heavily neutered, turned into another voting system. More people gained the ability to view offensive votes, and suddenly they looked just like the other voting systems - vote approval, vote to close, vote to delete, vote to delete as spam, vote to delete as offensive.\n\nAnd that's when i started really noticing a *lot* of offensive votes. When they looked and behaved just like every other vote. \n\nI *don't* think there should be an undo for flags. They shouldn't be used as a stick, with their removal a reward for better behavior. They should be reserved for situations where a post is unsalvageable - flag and move on.\n\nI *do* think close needs to be revamped to be less like flagging. It should be easier to close, and easier to re-open. Close votes should be retractable. Closing a post should be the first option for bad but salvageable   - close it, suggest improvements, open when it improves. \n\nI don't see any reason to allow posting answers to closed questions. When bad/OT posts get closed quickly, they don't collect a lot of answers or people trying to answer them - that's Good. Especially in the case of subjective/argumentative questions, you want to hold off all the subjective/argumentative answers until the question is improved to where it doesn't beg for them."}, {"author_name": "nobody_", "gravatar_hash": "325e29323813381fff4f0ed5c986c98b", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 11, 2009", "message": "@Shog9\n\nI agree that you get better feedback through comments than through the offensive flag. If flagging were not automatically coupled with deletion (and -100 rep) I would agree completely that there's no reason to see the flag count. If, like Hacker News, flagging a post simply requests moderator review of the post, then there's no real reason why anyone besides the moderators would need to see the flag count. However, when posts are deleted automatically, as is the case on Stack Overflow, it's important to be able to see how far away a post is from that threshold, especially since a deleted post is locked and cannot be undeleted except by starred moderators.\n\nAs far as reversibility goes, again I argue that as long as the offensive flag triggers automatic deletion there should be a way to reverse a flag you activated. The automatic expiration of flags works in this capacity to some extent, as well as the rollback method for resetting the flag count. However, there's no way for a person that's flagged a post to change their mind. If the flag were simply a cue for a moderator to review the post it wouldn't matter, but since automatic deletion is involved I think it's necessary.\n\nI have an idea that might act as a compromise: keep offensive vote counts hidden, but once a post has reached a certain threshold allow people to vote on the post's deletion. The current method to delete a question (aside from the offensive vote) is to close, wait two days, then delete. To prevent abuse, those that vote to delete can't have been the ones that flagged it as offensive. This might sound complicated, but the process is identical to the current method for closing without the two-day window in between.\n\nFinally, with regard to posting an answer to a closed question, I was trying to explain that it's frustrating after writing a fairly in-depth answer to a question it's suddenly closed without warning and you're forced to either toss your answer or try to integrate it with the existing ones. My strategy to avoid this has been to get an answer out fast (one or two sentences) to a question that looks like it might be closed then to edit it with the full answer, since edits are still allowed after a question is closed. However, oscillation between closed/open is still a problem that's being fed by the current mechanisms for closing and reopening a question. I think that both reversible votes and the ability to cast preemptive votes (i.e. \"keep open\" or \"keep closed\") can help to curb this issue."}, {"author_name": "Sam Hasler", "gravatar_hash": "5377323bbe24824de512a6a077fc77a3", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 11, 2009", "message": "Why no Best of Stack Overflow option?"}, {"author_name": "Shog9", "gravatar_hash": "ae15c48f686a0ecb39848f980b296611", "author_url": "http://www.shog9.com/", "date": "Apr 11, 2009", "message": "nobody_:\n&gt; I have an idea that might act as a compromise: keep \n&gt; offensive vote counts hidden, but once a post has \n&gt; reached a certain threshold allow people to vote on \n&gt; the post\u2019s deletion. \n\nThat effectively makes removing truly abusive posts a long, two-step process requiring twice as many active users. \n\nAnd for what? Abusive posts can and have been a problem at various points, but near as i can tell, malicious deletion by way of offensive voting has not been - yeah, there are questions that will collect a handful of offensive votes here and there, but it's rare to see them garner enough to actually do anything. With the count hidden, i expect to see this reduced further (no bandwagon jumping voters).\n\nIf the votes are deserved, then that will be obvious from the question itself. You can and should still warn the user who posted it, and if they care at all then they'll edit it, stop getting flagged, and eventually the cast votes will wear off. If they're inattentive, then the question will remain bad and be removed.

If it's closed for being a dup, then you should be provided with a link to the original, where you can post your answer; otherwise, the question was inappropriate and you should just move on - at least you were notified before you wasted too much time writing a long answer.\n\nI strongly suspect that this latter issue is only a real concern if you make a habit of answering extremely subjective / argumentative / Off-Topic questions. I've never written an answer to a programming question and found myself locked out...\n\nThat said, it *would* be nice to have the ability to retract a close vote, to avoid the long close/re-open process for questions where the author or an editor *is* able to substantially improve the question.\n\nCAPTCHA: not mecca"}, {"author_name": "cletus", "gravatar_hash": "2f364c2e36b52bc80296cbf23da8b231", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 11, 2009", "message": "I don't understand why the information is now only visible to moderators.
