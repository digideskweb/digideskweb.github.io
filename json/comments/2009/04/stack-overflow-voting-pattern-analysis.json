In my experience, reputation is much, much more heavily correlated with how invested someone is in the site than how competent they are. There are a lot of good hackers who have low rep just because they don't post all that often; and I've seen some people with moderately high rep who don't have much of a clue. Since upvotes increase rep so much faster than downvotes reduce it, someone who posts prolifically but gets as many down votes as up will still get a high reputation eventually."}, {"author_name": "Jeff Atwood", "gravatar_hash": "51d623f33f8b83095db84ff35e15dbe8", "author_url": "http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/", "date": "Apr 13, 2009", "message": "> someone who posts prolifically but gets as many down votes as up will still get a high reputation eventually.\n\nSure -- the time != value proposition\n\nhttp://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000524.html\n\nI think that's why some have proposed a \"divide rep by # of questions/answers\" sort of mechanic or statistic."}, {"author_name": "Zack", "gravatar_hash": "a27764e5c0529d03018cba073e612c3a", "author_url": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/83/zack", "date": "Apr 13, 2009", "message": "The SonicWALL Content Filtering Service thinks http://blog.stackoverflow.com/ is Pornography.\n\nhttp://img187.imageshack.us/img187/983/sonicwall.jpg\n\nhttp://cfssupport.sonicwall.com/Support/web/eng/newui/viewRating.jsp"}, {"author_name": "Peter", "gravatar_hash": "745edd0ed5ca0851d9134bff34dd6588", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 13, 2009", "message": "@Zack: LOL, I guess everybody has their own idea of what's hot :)"}, {"author_name": "nobody_", "gravatar_hash": "325e29323813381fff4f0ed5c986c98b", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 13, 2009", "message": "@Zach\n\nIt's probably due to all the pictures of scantily-clad servers Jeff's been posting\n\nhttp://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/01/new-stack-overflow-server-glamour-shots/"}, {"author_name": "Jon Skeet", "gravatar_hash": "6d8ebb117e8d83d74ea95fbdd0f87e13", "author_url": "http://csharpindepth.com", "date": "Apr 13, 2009", "message": "Dividing rep by #questions/answers wouldn't work without also removing the rep cap (or not applying the rep cap when calculating that value) - otherwise you're saying that 20 answers with 10 upvotes each (in a day) exhibits the same skill/value/whatever as a single answer with a single upvote. Both have a rep/answer value of 10, because of the rep cap of 200. Even if half of those answers are accepted, you end up with a rep/answer value of 17.5 - less than a unaccepted single answer with two upvotes.\n\nI haven't seen much sign of cluelessness amongst high-rep users - which isn't to say it's not there, of course. I'd say it's a measure of more than *just* time invested, but I don't really think it's important to try to pin down exactly what it means.\n\nRep is a measure of how many upvotes, accepted answers, downvotes etc you've received. Any attempt to correlate that to anything more meaningful will run into exceptions, subjectivity, strange aliasing effects due to things like the rep cap - any number of issues. It's best not to try to make that correlation in the first place, IMO."}, {"author_name": "Jon Skeet", "gravatar_hash": "6d8ebb117e8d83d74ea95fbdd0f87e13", "author_url": "http://csharpindepth.com", "date": "Apr 13, 2009", "message": "Thinking about it further, while I'd in no way want to absolutely equate time with value, I think there's a difference between \"skill\" and \"value to the site\" which should be acknowledged.\n\nConsider two developers - one is an \"average\" developer who spends an hour a day on Stack Overflow. He answers three or four questions a day, thoroughly and correctly but without ever needing or displaying brilliance. He's solid, but he'd never really \"wow\" you at an interview.\n\nNow let's suppose Linus Torvalds or Donald Knuth signed up, answered a single question absolutely brilliantly, and then disappeared in the end.\n\nSurely there's no question as to which developer is the most skillful/competent. However, which is actually of more value *to Stack Overflow* as a resource? The \"plodder\" IMO.\n\n\nI'm not entirely sure that I support the way that downvotes matter so much less than upvotes, as it precisely means that you *can* get away with gaining rep from a question where 9 people downvote you for being incompetent but 2 misguided souls upvote you. The answer will show as -7 of course, but you'll still have gained 2 rep.\n\nI'm a bit of an extremist when it comes to accuracy, as any readers of my book reviews will know - I find the general accuracy level of technical books to be somewhere between dismaying and shocking. I apply the same thoughts to Stack Overflow answers, albeit slightly less strictly, as at least no-one's *paid* for inaccurate answers. I think it's a pity that people can write complete rubbish and still earn a positive reputation. However, I think relatively few people actually do that. I suspect that most people would be pretty ashamed of answers with strongly negative scores and would try harder to be more accurate next time. Maybe I'm just too optimistic though.\n\nAnyway, the overall point of this waffle is that while I don't support inaccuracy at all, I *do* think that a mixture of competence and dedication is a very good thing for the site. Frankly, relatively few questions *call* for brilliance.

It encourages upvotes en slightly discourages downvotes. \n\nThere are two sides to the story. Per question/answer the ratio is one on one (each upvote is countered by a single downvote). Which is cool because this gives the community a tool to order the answers according to the common common sense (pun intended). \n\nRep is another story. If you provide usefull content (again according to the community) you will gain some points. And yes you sometimes get a lot of points with a silly answer and the brilliant answer that took a lot of work only got a few upvotes (if any).\n\nI view a downvote as a signal. Most of the time it turns out I haven't understand the question or there is new information added. Normally I delete these answers or I edit them. So the overall quality of the answers is enhanced.\n\nIf there is a real bad answer with lots of upvotes, you can either provide a better one and comment on the bad answer. Or you can call it offensive (if it is) or warn a mod (which is a cool new feature). But in the end, the community decides.
