It seems entirely random to me when a subjective question is allowed to stay and when it is deleted. \n\nThe \\does anyone else think this version of MSDN is preferable\\ is clearly not a real question, does not solve a problem, and was just someone who wanted to share his/her discovery, for example.

HTML?\\\n\nOn the other hand, this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/756063/do-you-have-a-physical-developer-busy-indicator-closed clearly seems to fall under \\Questions about social engineering, management, or career building, ergonomics, or other \u201csoft\u201d topics related to development work.\\, yet it was closed as \\not programming related\\. One closer said he closed it because it was \\subjective and argumentative\\, but it was clearly not argumentative (maybe the closer does not know what that word means?), and subjective is an often used tag with almost 4000 questions, so clearly that in itself is not a problem.\n\nI really understand that closing and deleting is subjective as well.

How do they work?\" has one good answer, collaboratively written, describing the mechanics of the \"close\" feature on SO. \n\nFor SO-related questions that DO NOT fit that model, questions that beg for discussion, SO does not work; \"StackOverflow: Why do people close questions?\" has no one answer that could be considered canonical, ultimately requiring this blog post to settle the matter. \n\nAs Jeff notes, the proliferation of the latter ultimately reduce the utility of the former; concrete answers to specific questions are lost in the noise. A search for \"[sofaq] closing\" now returns 31 questions; a search for \"[sofaq]\" returns hundreds of questions; a search for \"[stackoverflow]\" returns hundreds more. Finding a specific answer has become a tedious process; keeping answers up-to-date and accurate is almost a lost cause. \n\nCan you imagine how bad it would be if most SO-related questions *weren't* immediately closed and later deleted?"}, {"author_name": "Jess Sightler", "gravatar_hash": "eac4001b8c054ee994480f0a6e2cdcf8", "author_url": "http://www.jroller.com/jsight/", "date": "Apr 18, 2009", "message": "&gt; too hypothetical of a \u201cwhat if\u201d to stay open IMO.

Some of the sofaq question are indeed good, fitting for SO, with properly voted answers. Great. At least let's have these. The not-so-good questions will naturally get lower votes, so the SO effect applies to them and they'll eventually annoy us less.\n\nYou're basically saying that some SO related questions, like some programming questions, don't have clear answers or are argumentative - fine. Close them like you would any other \"bad\" question; but this has nothing to do with being _about_ SO. The mere fact that a question is about SO, right now, causes it to close and thus not get properly answered and voted on. \n\nAlso, I really don't get the whole \"may have a single answer\" criterion you're applying. Since when do programming questions have single answers? That's probably untrue for 99% of questions. That's part of the reason why SO has voting, not just marking \"correct\" answers.\nIf there are conflicting views on SO related issues, let those views all be voiced and voted on. When discussions do occur naturally once in a while (as is the case with programming questions) then they can be held in comments. Not an ideal forum, but (again) NEITHER IS UserVoice. In fact, UV is a much worse place to hold discussions (have you tried? it's a terrible system)."}, {"author_name": "Shog9", "gravatar_hash": "ae15c48f686a0ecb39848f980b296611", "author_url": "http://www.shog9.com/", "date": "Apr 19, 2009", "message": "Assaf:\n&gt; Are you sure the sad state of sofaq you describe \n&gt; isn\u2019t _because_ of the fact so many questions are \n&gt; closed before good answers can be provided for them?\n\nSure - have a look, please:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged?tagnames=sofaq\n\nThe problem isn't that there are too many closed questions - there aren't - it's that there are too many questions, *period*. Questions that are unanswerable, questions that are answered already as part of another FAQ, questions that are flat-out duplicates of an existing FAQ...\n\nA FAQ that grows to include every question anyone might ever have... loses the Frequently, leaving simply Asked Questions. \n\nBut don't take my word for it:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/stackoverflow\n\nSort by newest, and go through a few - try to find the relevant FAQ entry by searching SO. See how long it takes you...\n\nAssaf:\n&gt; The not-so-good questions will naturally get lower \n&gt; votes, so the SO effect applies to them and they\u2019ll \n&gt; eventually annoy us less.\n\nSO's voting system relies on people coming to SO with specific questions, finding answers that help and up-voting them, and finding answers that don't and down-voting them. \n\nThat system falls apart for SO questions for two primary reasons:\n\n  1) People don't come to SO to ask SO questions.\n  2) People don't vote on unhelpful questions, they ask their own question, thus contributing to the noise.\n\nWhen's the last time you down-voted a SO question for not being helpful to SO? If the system worked for SO questions, we wouldn't face the problem we face now - therefore, it does not.\n\nAssaf:\n&gt; Also, I really don\u2019t get the whole \u201cmay have a \n&gt; single answer\u201d criterion you\u2019re applying. Since \n&gt; when do programming questions have single answers?\n\n\"How do i fill a solid-color rectangle using Win32 GDI?\" True, that question has at least 4-5 specific answers... but for any given situation you're only going to pick one - either the question will be specific enough to indicate one of them, or a single reply can be composed outlining the pros/cons of each approach.\n\nI must apologize - i'm conflating \"answer\" and \"reply\". Any given problem will have one best answer, but a question on SO may not be specific enough to indicate what that answer should be - hence, the semi-wiki power of SO, which allows for melding individual answers into a single reply. \n\nOf course, there are plenty of questions that have *no* good answers; those often still collect opinionated replies, but which one you consider \"best\" will depend entirely on your subjective opinion. SO is little more than a straw-poll system when it comes to these questions; you may learn something from reading the responses, but the top-voted reply indicates little beyond a preference in those who bothered to read it - unlike an answer to a specific question, these replies are rarely verifiable.\n\nAssaf:\n&gt; If there are conflicting views on SO related \n&gt; issues, let those views all be voiced and voted on.\n\nAnd what? What's the outcome? This works to an extent for coming up with internal standards (such as the format for indicating dup posts), so long as enough people are interested in the question to make it work... but does nothing at all for reporting bugs in the system, or contesting the implementation of specific features (beyond, yet again, contributing to the noise). Anything that requires a SO dev to take action based on the outcome is useless on SO, since there's no guarantee a SO dev will ever see it. Like it or not, that's what UserVoice is for...\n\nAssaf:\n&gt; In fact, UV is a much worse place to hold \n&gt; discussions (have you tried? it\u2019s a terrible\n&gt; system).\n\nI hate UV.
