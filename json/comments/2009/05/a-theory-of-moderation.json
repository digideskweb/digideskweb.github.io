It would have been exceedingly easy for the poster to respond with: http://stackoverflow.com/faq , a document which any intelligent person would agree clearly welcomes his exact type of question, essentially providing the aforementioned fact/reference/etc... \n\nUnfortunately however, instead of allowing the user to elaborate or rephrase his question, Will  shut him down out of hand. NOT because the question had generated an unwelcome slew of opinion based responses / arguments, but because it was Wills OPINION that the question MIGHT LEAD TO EXTENDED DISCUSSIONS.\n\nIt's hard to believe that this guy, who apparently has no expertise outside of some rudimentary .NET ( http://stackoverflow.com/users/1228/will?tab=questions&amp;sort=views ), has been given the power to unilaterally decide whether or not another user has the right to ask a question in an open forum like this.  I'm getting angry again now, so I'll leave it at that."}, {"author_name": "Eric", "gravatar_hash": "76ced421878bd595cffecdaf995827c8", "author_url": "http://klickitmedia@gmail.com", "date": "Nov 04, 2012", "message": "\"The short answer is, as little as possible!\"\nI disagree with this post.
