This will make it easier to pare down my list of interesting/ignored tags.\n\nHowever, with this new partial matching feature, you might want to also rethink the edge case of what happens when a question has both interesting and ignored tags, or when a single tag is triggered by a partial match in both interesting and ignored. The current behavior, which is to have both the orange background and an opaque white foreground, is probably not the correct approach. Also, if you have \"Hide Ignored Tags\" checked in your preferences, the question won't appear at all.\n\nWhile this may seem like the correct thing to do, personally I would prefer the approach that an interesting tag supersedes an ignored tag, for much the same reason why it's a bigger deal for a spam filter to have false positives than false negatives.

Anyone can get behind a fun, new feature to vote it up.  But a bug might only be noticed or reproducible by a few people.
