Yeah, that's a real turn off.\n\nGenerally speaking however I don't vote down duplicates, particularly for new users, where it's simply an honest mistake. This is especially the case since the search on SO is, well, not great. Using google is better but you can't really expect a newbie to know that (yet).\n\nVoting down seems punitive and pointless.\n\nThere's no reason you can't be positive and courteous while pointing someone to a duplicate and I'm honestly surprised and somewhat disheartened when they aren't."}, {"author_name": "Jeff Atwood", "gravatar_hash": "51d623f33f8b83095db84ff35e15dbe8", "author_url": "http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/", "date": "May 21, 2009", "message": "some tweaks went out tonight, as well as some bugfixes.
