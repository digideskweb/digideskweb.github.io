This can explain, among other things, the phenomenon of \"choking\", where a sportsperson (or someone in some other high-stakes discipline) overthinks what they're supposed to be doing and simply freezes or otherwise becomes incompetent.\n\nI'm sure the same analogy could be extended to programming. A reliance on emperical evidence, to the detriment of your intuition, could lead to a less than effective programmer. At worse, it could lead to a severely defective programmer.\n\nSo the question is, how do we improve our intuitions? Is it all just down to practice, practice and yet more practice?"}, {"author_name": "TheTXI", "gravatar_hash": "75c1b8bc6bd8631a53b246e43caf4dc6", "author_url": null, "date": "May 14, 2009", "message": "Nice to see some more concrete guidance on the newbie questions.
