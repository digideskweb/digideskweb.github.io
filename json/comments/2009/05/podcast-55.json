Unfortunately, multimedia suffers the same sort of problem that traditional documentation -- it's usually out of date.  Even worse, multimedia is even more expensive to maintain.

Do you now have to delete it and re-record all of it over, correcting the bits that were wrong?  Do you leave it and append another snippet amending the previous explanation?   You can't just leave it, because now it's wrong.\n\nEventually I concluded that it's much better just to write code that's as clear as possible and explain the things that aren't obvious.  Doing it the most lightweight way possible makes the most sense because eventually you'll need to update it or delete it as it becomes out of date.

Which language you pick has a *huge* impact on what idiomatic code will look like - if you try to write C++ code in Java (which I've seen) you'll end up with a mess. If you use F# but make everything mutable, never use recursion etc you'll end up fighting it every step of the way.\n\nThe programming languages you learn affect how you think about problems, which is why I believe it's worth knowing a variety - for example, if you know SQL, C, Python, Java and F# you'll get a reasonably rounded view of the world. You can apply *some* of the ideas from one paradigm in another (for instance, writing functional code in C# often feasible, but without things like tail recursion some aspects don't work terribly well) so it's nice to get a broader idea of what solutions are out there.\n\n(I wasn't particularly *recommending* those languages, by the way - but they cover a broad set of paradigms.

I think that plugins that as you say \"plug the holes\" in a product are doomed in commercial settings.  But you still want a good plugin architecture in order to enable connections between tools and allow custom plugins inside organizations.\n\nFor example, VMWare has some visual studio plugins to integrate reverse debugging and other VMWare features with Visual Studio.  That kind of integration between tools is immune to being subsumed by Microsoft (I guess if they did provide that themselves, it would make VMWare happy as it saves them money). \n\nAnother example where a commercial tool has a successful business model with plugins is Matlab -- there are hundreds of analysis packages available for Matlab for all kinds of fields, many of them developed by academics who then share the revenues with the Mathworks company.  In principle, Matlab could develop these themselves, but why would they? In this way, they ensure a stream of qualified add-ons without spending their own development resources on it. \n\nYet another example are things like integrations between IDEs and source control systems like Rational Clearcase or build systems like Rational Buildforge. Sure, an MS might attempt to replace that entire system, but for the enterprises using these tools, it makes lots of sense to integrate with Visual Studio. There is no conflict of interest here. \n\nIn a sense, the Apple iTunes Application store is also an example of leveraging plugin developers to create an attractive platform. It is clear that some really useful iPhone apps will be designed-out by Apple in years to come... but the model they have with revenue sharing currently makes apparent sense to a lot of developers.\n\n/jakob"}, {"author_name": "mmyers", "gravatar_hash": "3dd46fff5f873b7026ba6bae47a0f3b4", "author_url": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/13531/mmyers", "date": "May 29, 2009", "message": "A few years ago when I was in college, I used a microprocessor-assembly development environment (TExAS [http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/sim.html ], coincidentally developed at U Texas) that operated on RTF files.
