I completely agree to the importance of proper planning and the basic rule that you need to produce the texts seen from the perspective of the potential target group and this part I think is not so easy. So a lot of research is needed and it takes time because it must be as accurate as possible and it costs money and these troubled times the client looks carefully at the cost/benefit picture in order to get the finest ROI. Another important issue is how to handle this in the smartest way since DM by the Internet can easily be considered Spam and then result in nothing. As in any other business intelligence is needed."}]}
