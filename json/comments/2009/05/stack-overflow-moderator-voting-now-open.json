For the same reasons that Jon withdrew, are these the best people to be spending time moderating instead of doing what they normally do, which imho adds the most value, and that is answering questions.\n\nSecondly, what exactly is the job of the moderator going to be? My view is it should be a largely hands off force of last resort kind of thing to settle disputes and so on but that's just my opinion. I'm not sure if it's ever been stated what Jeff &amp; co are expecting from a moderator and what stnadards they should be upholding. This is important information in voting.\n\nLastly, we have 25 or so names on the voting list but only a single vote. This is called a first past the post system that is used wideley in elections but is really not a good idea once you get a large number of parties involved. There are some names on that list that will never win, not because there is anything wrong with them but simply because they just aren't that well known.\n\nIt's somewhat unfortunate that how well you're known is going to be a large deciding factor in all this and the way to get known is to answer the questions in tags that are most often used and viewed. And that basically means C# so chances are the \"winner\" will be one of the big C# contributors. That's going to exclude--or at least disadvantage--some otherwise good candidates.\n\nBut back to the FPTP system: just like in presidential elections, a vote for a minor party is a wasted vote. This'll change voting I think so that it will be *heavily* skewed towards 5 ppeople or less (imho).
