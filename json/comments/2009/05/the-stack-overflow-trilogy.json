Information here is more geared towards client-side programs, and Operating System configuration, such as installing Windows programs, and troubleshooting registry problems, etc.\n\nIt's not meant to be a distinction between \"I maintain a big business so my questions are more important\", rather, it's made to be a dividing line between the kinds of problems discussed. A server will be running very different software than a home PC. That said, if you're trying to set up something that *would likely* be done a lot on real business servers (like a test server for Apache, to use the example again) then your question is still quite appropriate for Server Fault. \n\nThe distinction is more to categorize the problems than to decide that certain problems are more important than others. Someone who is good at answering linux server problems doesn't want to have to wade through a sea of windows client problems to look for an answer, and vice versa. I think that's the point of them being separate sites.\n\nBut that's my opinion of course. I plan to use *both* sites, since I maintain a lot of different servers, and also consider myself a power user at home."}, {"author_name": "Drew Gibson", "gravatar_hash": "dc5e4e4387374e20efffa31eb7608ef9", "author_url": null, "date": "Jun 02, 2009", "message": "+1 for the new 3rd site guys... it was an obvious move but one that'll be gratefully received I'm sure :)\n\nCheers !"}, {"author_name": "Klelky", "gravatar_hash": "24b0bc1aa9599ca5b59300376b12a8b2", "author_url": null, "date": "Jun 02, 2009", "message": "@nobody_ To be honest, I thought the re-tagging was ok.

I think is really interesting that Jeff is going down this route as (inspired by Stackoverflow) I am really trying to push my work's disparate community discussion forums together.\n\nSomeone else above makes the point that google is the start point for most users, so maybe it doesn't matter that people are less likely to go from one site to another. Perhaps putting these divisions in place gives a focus to the sites for the regular users and there are less users than we might imagine who have an interest in more than one of the trilogy.\n\nAll that said - I think SuperUser could be huge in its own right!"}, {"author_name": "Peter Boughton", "gravatar_hash": "e915239e11bb00291ce4e4b17b83bc66", "author_url": "http://blog.bpsite.net", "date": "Jun 02, 2009", "message": "&gt;&gt; ...
