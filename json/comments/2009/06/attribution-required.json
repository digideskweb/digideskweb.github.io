Coming back to and reading this again raised a question regarding StackQL.net (and by extension StatOverflow.com/sandbox as well). \n\nReading over this again, it looks like StackQL technically violates item #4 for your required attribution list.  We mention where the content comes from, try to link back to original questions by matching any column name in the result set that ends with PostID, QuestionID, or AnswerID, and make author names available in the results unless a user specifically excludes them from a result set by not selecting * or not selecting OwnerDisplayName.  \n\nBut it doesn't link those author names back to profiles, and that sounds like a violation.  StackQL does create a link for any item in query results where the column name ends with \"UserID\", so links are created; they're just not attached to the name.\n\nAside from this one (minor) point I think the site does everything reasonable to follow the attribution guidelines.  Even here I think I'm following the spirit of what you're asking for, but it does fail when held up to the letter of law, so to speak.  StatOverflow does even less, but I doubt you have any problems with it either.\n\nCould you clarify the public attribution requirements in a way that makes us less legally murky?
