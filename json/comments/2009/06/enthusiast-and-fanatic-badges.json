Good job on these. Of course Jon will get them anyway but thats neither here nor there. :)\n\nThe point is that while participation is related to answers, it's not a direct consequence. You can answer a lot of questions and be on erratically. You can be on consistently and not answer (or ask) a lot of questions.
