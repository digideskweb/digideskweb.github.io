So it'd only be introducing a new 25 gold badges or so, growing with the site. While it is true that most of the time the user will already have a gold badge for that tag, being the all time leader is a distinction that becomes more important the more the site grows. I mean, as it is right now, c# already has 5 gold badges and a whopping 30 silver badges. Being the leader of the pack screams a badge.\n\nFull disclosure: I am a little biased as I currently have no Gold badges and would gain 3, maybe 4 from this. I do think the double counting is a valid concern, but as far as badges go I think this would be about as deserved as it gets, especially considering that Gold badges are almost never awarded for actual programming knowledge (http://stackoverflow.uservoice.com/pages/1722-general/suggestions/165033-gold-badges-are-virtually-never-awarded-for-real-questions).\n\nAll that being said, I don't see Jeff doing this, but it'd be nice. Aside from that, I do think there needs to be a lot of new badges - not gold but silver and bronze badges for simple things like first accepted answer to things like X total accepted answers, etc. As silly as they are badges are a driving factor for a lot of people and there's a lot of wasted \"events\" without a badge right now."}, {"author_name": "Cletus", "gravatar_hash": "2f364c2e36b52bc80296cbf23da8b231", "author_url": "http://www.cforcoding.com", "date": "Jun 03, 2009", "message": "I like this feature but the placement is rather awkward and not terribly intuitive.
