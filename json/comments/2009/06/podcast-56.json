Joel and Jason were in the same room. It's easier to talk to someone and read the body language of someone who is in the same room as you. Ever tried to attend a meeting where one group of people is in a conference room around a speakerphone and you're dialing in remotely? It's a totally different experience than when you're all in one room together, and you do end up feeling a little left out, making you less likely to chime in.\n\n2. Joel is more business-y than Jeff, and Jason is a businessman. That said, I think Jeff made some excellent business-related remarks.\n\nI wouldn't say this is a trend either (or at least not an obvious one). Jeff is quiet for long periods from time to time, but I don't think it correlates to having/not having guests.\n\nThis was my favorite episode yet, and I went into it expecting something totally different. The couple times Joel had knocked Mahalo Answers made me think there would be blood. In reality, it was just a really interesting conversation between people who love to make great websites."}, {"author_name": "Shog9", "gravatar_hash": "ae15c48f686a0ecb39848f980b296611", "author_url": "http://www.shog9.com/", "date": "Jun 03, 2009", "message": "@William: There's a third reason i've come up with: Joel is used to saying whatever's on his mind, no matter how much of it is utter BS.

Some badges on Bolt were given out by moderators (e.g. featured member).  Other badges were given out automatically (e.g. anniversary badges).  Bolt's badge system was similar IMO to Stackoverflow and like your Woot badge, Bolt did have sponsored badges.  Regardless, while you are not the first website to use badges, your implementation is quite good.  In fact, I just recently added a similar badge system to my website (www.testdesigner.com) to encourage positive behavior."}, {"author_name": "\u00d3lafur Waage", "gravatar_hash": "89b8f4a7429270308ac301bf7605f974", "author_url": "http://www.cznp.com/", "date": "Jun 04, 2009", "message": "Very good guest on this podcast.\n\nWhen you have such an interesting guest, you probably cant help to just sit and listen.

Jason Calacanis is normally kind of weird, but Joel balanced him out nicely, which made for an interesting conversation.\n\nJust one point about Jason Calacanis' insinuation that Germans steal copyrighted stuff: Germany is not China. Germany has a \"normal\" copyright law similar to that of the US. So German \"site copies\" are usually re-implementations of a similar or the same idea. I believe there are a lot of \"site copies\" in Germany because Germans learn English somewhat late in School. For example, when Facebook was English-only, it made sense to create a \"German Facebook\" because a lot of people were not able to use the original version!\n\nAlso, I wish Jeff had pushed Jason harder on the whole sharecropping thing. I think Jeff's original point was that it was unfair to let users do the work and then \"steal\" their data. This point got lost when Jason started talking about money (as he is wont to do)."}, {"author_name": "Niall", "gravatar_hash": "35dee64cae8f37ded5923296625a16b9", "author_url": null, "date": "Jun 04, 2009", "message": "Jason Calacanis is funny as hell.

Of course, this is just my experience.\n\nAs far as the user question regarding \"Dreaming in Code\" and whether \"software development is really hard or not.\" I think that is sort of a silly question. I say \"silly\" because it seems disingneious. The idea that \"writing software is not really hard. I've been doing it since I was 4 years old\" or whatever is just ridiculous. When people like Brooks, and well, pretty much every other sane person in the world, talk about software being hard, we are talking about complex software systems. How many Linux kernel developers do you know that keep the whole kernel in their heads? Hint: not even Linus does. I just found that question self-serving or perhaps to be more charitable, naive.\n\nAs for the \"digital sharecropping\" stuff. I think we should get rid of that term. That's just ridiculous. I have to agree with Jason on this one. I think he was being kind by not laughing at that or perhaps was a little surprised to hear that.

The Korean web business model is about walled-garden portals rather than an open linked web.\n\nAnd it's worth remembering that this isn't some unimportant backwater we're talking about here.
