When you are \"happy to point people to those docs\" the way in which you implement that \"pointing\" is through an Answer on SO. Therefore, an answer exists for that question on SO, it simply cites another source, which is perfectly acceptable. The other thing is for Joel it's about SO being where the search engine resuls point the user first. I think it also helps because even if there is a doc on MSDN that you, Jon Skeet, will point the user, at least your answer can be voted on and in the future the answer can be modified if something changes.\n\nIt's also nice having the answer on SO so you don't have to deal with MSDN (or whatever) saying \"This page has been moved, you will be sent into a vortex of circular redirection while we try to fruitlessly locate that document.\"\n\nCAPTHCA: you've dueled"}, {"author_name": "BobbyShaftoe", "gravatar_hash": "526f22eb98e81ea305bdcf777e4f733d", "author_url": null, "date": "Jun 18, 2009", "message": "Eh, one more thing.
