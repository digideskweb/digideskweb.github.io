Didn't you say that interpreted languages are so slow that it doesn't even matter? http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000838.html\n1. Comparing Ruby + Rails to straight PHP makes no sense but is what most people do, they usually don't compare similarly complex queries across Lang + MVC Framework.\n2. In raw language comparisons it depends on what you're measuring, sometimes PHP comes ahead, sometimes ruby.\n3. It's hard not to build a Rails app that won't scale horizontally as far as actual rails processes go. The DB won't scale of course, but that's not a lang issue.\n4. With Rails metal, a mechanism to bypass the entire stack and code straight ruby for extremely high performance pages, you can get performance similar to a  plain php script.\n5. Memcached and HTTP caching make a lot of performance problems go away so quickly."}, {"author_name": "JulianR", "gravatar_hash": "d2f65b970cccd83fa86bb4c4600d490c", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 18, 2009", "message": "I was wondering how you handled the performance of LINQ-to-SQL.

The thought of needing to denormalize scares me.\n\nThe nice thing about modern databases is that \"denormalization\" is often a semi-automated process.  Instead of changing your code to duplicate data, you make new materialized views (db terminology varies) that improve performance, without so much extra code to maintain redundant data.  It isn't nearly as scary as it used to be, imo.\n\nAlthough, this is one area where commercial stacks help.  I don't know of any FOSS dbs with solid materialized view support at the moment."}, {"author_name": "lhahne", "gravatar_hash": "33974ac55e5240bcc34a067a5644726c", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 20, 2009", "message": "It would be nice to see some performance comparisons on asp.net mvc on .Net and Mono."}, {"author_name": "Bernard Dy", "gravatar_hash": "f3ac9b6f28ad2e46e86ddb85b217c6fd", "author_url": "http://www.burningends.blogspot.com/", "date": "Jul 20, 2009", "message": "Thanks for the link.
