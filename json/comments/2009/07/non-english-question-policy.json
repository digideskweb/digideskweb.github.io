I think in beta, or shortly after launch, seeing a post in some other language.  It got a lot of negative feedback for being in another language, and I then felt (and still feel) it rather... rude to just block out other languages.\n\nGranted, the features that give the most bang for the buck should be tackled first, so take this with a grain of salt.  I feel like there could be a pretty reasonable way to support multiple languages, but keep the communities separate at the same time.\n\nThink Wikipedia and the separation of the various languages.  I think this analogy works great, and it might even be easy for you to implement, given the already broken up sister sites.  es.stackoverflow.com could become a brand new site (just like serverfault and superuser), except it shares the same styles of stackoverflow.  The difference is, it is for espanol (pardon lack of tilde) speaking people.  But in every other respect, it acts as a new community... new reputation, separate set of questions, etc.\n\nThe same kind of separation could work for as many languages as you see fit, though there are probably a few key languages that would gain the most traction if you built them.\n\nI think it would be an interesting experiment, and a great way for you to expand the business with minimal effort.  You could test drive it with a language you know would have some amount of traction, like Mandarin Chinese, German, or some other language where there is a large amount of developers that natively speak it.\n\nYou could probably crowd source the localization to some extent (provide a public place for people to translate the list of strings needing translation, and I'm sure the community would step up and fill in for you, at least if there is any interest for the given language).\n\nPlease consider it... it would be pretty cool to see Stack Overflow be the defacto place for ALL people of ALL cultures and ALL languages.  If you provide a way for people to duplicate questions among the languages, and change to be translated to that language... you might gain a boost in content as interesting content is translated by bilingual users."}, {"author_name": "JP", "gravatar_hash": "2bbfeae515500e1b7eb41dc8e8d396f6", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 23, 2009", "message": "Sorry to say this -- but this is the typical attitude of Americans: They do not know *any* second language and expect all other people to speak english at least half-decently.
