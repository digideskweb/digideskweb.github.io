If you want to code for xyz platform, seems to me you're better off using the native tools.\n\nRegarding GC on the iPhone, I have read and personally heard statements from Apple engineers that they left GC out of the iPhone OS due to hardware performance limitations. Given that they already have an ObjC runtime with GC in mass deployment (Leopard) and the ABI is the same other than the GC bit, what do you believe their rationale is if not hardware performance?\n\nJust because a lot of apps don't conform to the HIG doesn't mean it's worthless. The good apps do. There are crap apps for every platform under the sun. As stated in the name, they are 'guidelines', not requirements.\n\nIn my experience, non-native toolkits often just 'don't feel right' and it usually has to do with UI issues.

They want to make iPhone apps because of the stories of gold, but they want to learn as little as possible about it. That is the wrong way to go about things in general and making iPhone development possible from Visual Studio (or the VS-alike MonoDevelop) using C# is just going to result in a rash of even worse iPhone apps. \n\nI mean honestly, if you are too clueless to work out how memory is managed in Objective-C then you are too clueless to program full-stop.\n\nFWIW I think that the iPhone gold-rush is pretty-much over now anyway. Individuals and companies will still be making money from selling apps for a long time to come of course, but there won't be the influx of newbie programmers that there has been. This does not bode well for companies starting now on tools for making iPhone development easier.

Oh, and I never owned a Mac before I started doing iPhone development.\n\nBut while a lot of people (including people I know are great programmers) wasted a ton of energy whining about \"gee, do I really have to use a Mac\" and \"man, objective-c sucks\" etc. I decided I was going to learn how to do everything the right way from the beginning so that when I made assessments about how the platform compared to others I've written for, I could do it from a neutral point of view instead of one that was stupidly biassed one way (the \"Cocoa is my girlfriend\" guy) or the other (most .NET converts I hear from).\n\nIn reality none of it is actually hard, you just have to go in with the attitude that you're going to have to learn everything eventually so try and learn how to do things in the proper platform-centric way from the beginning and you'll find it a lot easier.\n\nGo in with the attitude that you just want to make money while putting in the least possible effort and everything will seem like a chore.
