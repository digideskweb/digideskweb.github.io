Plugin that connects to a commercial product.  IE company 1 makes a product, company 2 makes a product and also makes a plugin for company 1's product to connect them together.  If your product is valuable in itself as a standalone, then the plugin is added value - and if it gets integrated into the platform, then that's just free marketing for your real product.  Balsamiq plugin for FogBugz is an example - Balsamiq's business is selling Balsamiq, not the plugin, and that's still true even if they charge for the plugin.\n\n2. Plugins that break the business model of the core product.  I'm thinking of AdBlockPlus here - FireFox don't want to put it in the main product as it would wipe out the ads on the integrated Google search, which is their main income source.\n\n3. Plugins that intrinsically need to cost money.  If the plugin gives access to subscription data, then it won't get pulled into the main product unless the developer can find a free way of getting the same data.  There are some stock tickers that come to mind.\n\n4. Plugins that make the product UI more complex.  My best example here is NoScript.  I use it and like it, but I know I'm always adding new sites to my whitelist.  I've dealt with a lot of users who are not prepared to put up with that - it's an extra UI step that they don't want to have to deal with."}, {"author_name": "John", "gravatar_hash": "0fc637a07270d4dfbf6958a281a5305e", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 23, 2009", "message": "Jeff, I find it interesting you like automatic updates so much but also hate the software that comes with things like digital cameras.  \n\nWhat about companies that push crapware out through their auto-update system?  \n\nWhat about new features that get pushed out and cause problems and confusion?\n\nI have to agree with Joel on this one, I don't like auto-updates.

To achieve this, it\u2019s essential that your application perform all software update procedures at launch time only.\"\n\nNot sure whether this was what Mozilla were thinking of when providing updates this way for Firefox, but certainly with applications for the Mac this seems to be encouraged."}, {"author_name": "Overflowing Stacks", "gravatar_hash": "b5b2064e1990869b96b45dbcb51d69fc", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 23, 2009", "message": "I couldn't disagree more with the idea that all software should just be silently updated without any warning.  Using Firefox as an example (since it was mentioned many times in the podcast): new releases of Firefox occasionally break a significant percentage of existing plugins until the plugins are updated to the new version.   Do you really want Firefox updating you to such a version without any kind of warning?   I don't.  I'd much rather wait the update out a few months and only make the move when the plugins *I* use have been updated (and keep in mind that the set of plugins that are must haves is different for every person, so you can't even fallback on a solution like pushing the Firefox update once plugins X, Y and Z have been updated to the new version.\n\nThis isn't unique to Firefox, of course, and there are many reasons (other than plugin problems) why updating to the newest version doesn't always make sense.  The newest version could be incredibly buggy, the developers could have made UI changes for the worse, etc, etc.\n\nAlso, I'm completely fed up with every company thinking they absolutely need to run a persistent update manager daemon in my system tray.  No matter how well behaved they make their updater, the model just doesn't scale, once I've got 5 different updaters running there is going to be just that much more chance of them causing system performance issues, or UI issues, etc.   Unless the software vendors can agree to one unified updater service they really need to fuck off with these things, they reach a point where they are almost as bad as malware just because you're running so many of them.\n\nLastly, the podcast really needs more guests.  Episodes with guests (like last week) are fantastic, episodes without guests, not so much.  You guys are falling into the trap that Joel used to avoid by publishing longer blog posts less frequently.  I can pretty much predict what each of you is going to say through the entire podcast once I know what the topic of the podcast is."}, {"author_name": "Overflowing Stacks", "gravatar_hash": "b5b2064e1990869b96b45dbcb51d69fc", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 23, 2009", "message": "@Alex,\n\nApple guidelines or not, I think it makes much more sense to do updates at shutdown time.   This is what Windows Update does by default these days and I *much* prefer it.   In the case of Windows updates, it will download the available updates but not install them (unless you manually tell it to install them sooner) until you shut the system down, as part of the shutdown process.  This is awesome because I can just tell the system to shut down, walk away, and the updates are being installed when I don't care that the updates are impacting my ability to use the system because I've already walked away from it.\n\nI believe the same system applied to applications (having them update in the background, after I close them) would also be much preferable to them interrupting me as soon as I open them.   I totally agree with Joel on this, update manager dialogs that pop up as soon as you open an app are totally frustrating because you are almost always opening the app up with a purpose to get something done *now*, and even having to think about the update is just a context switch that is annoying and unnecessary."}, {"author_name": "mgb", "gravatar_hash": "7010f170ec917b56e173f3978c459e0e", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 23, 2009", "message": "I think Apple's concept was correct but their wording was poor.
