Have you considered storing your state in Memcached?  Memory is cheep, after all.  This helps you not raise your CPU usage on the database.\n\nAnother concern Jeff had was how the caching would work.  There is a two-part solution that I recently implemented for this.  Using nginx (http://nginx.net/) and Memcached (http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpMemcachedModule), you can do some great things.  Your application servers can cache a page into Memcached, and nginx can serve this data back automagically.  This allows you to offload the serving of cached data from your app servers into your load balancer itself.\n\nI found that using this method reduced CPU load significantly and increased page load time by ~10% (granted this was a home-brewed perl app, so grain of salt and all)."}, {"author_name": "Kevin Dente", "gravatar_hash": "23c1e2063688620b75b248e08c0d5c24", "author_url": "http://weblogs.asp.net/kdente", "date": "Jul 30, 2009", "message": "Apparently Joel is not familiar with the mean of \"release candidate\" as used my Microsoft now.
