Likewise I get more than a dollar a book (about $2 I think, but it depends on the exact nature of the sale) and there are additional income streams like translation rights.\n\nOn the work side, it took almost exactly a year from the first words being typed to it going to the printer. However, that wasn't a year of full time work - it was a year of full spare time work, if you see what I mean. I would *guess* at 330 days of 3 hours a day, so about 1000 hours. That may well be an overestimate though - 3 hours is a pretty hefty evening's work.\n\nAll that being said, you don't get into writing tech books to make money. (Children's books?
