The next morning I was greeted with a DynDNS error message saying that the domain name had some issues.  Does this mean GoDaddy use DynDNS too?  Even worse, could you still end up with exactly the same problem?"}, {"author_name": "Chris", "gravatar_hash": "36d0a0127e22acd5eb1922d8b44f0cf6", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 11, 2009", "message": "Interesting choice.  I use EasyDNS for a personal domain.. it costs something like $15/year and I've never had the slightest problem with it.  Where I work, we use Dynect.  We've also never had a problem with it.  The only difference I can see is that it quite literally costs thousands of times more.  The company can afford it, but I'm not really sure what they get for it.  They're in an industry where everyone else uses Dynect, so I guess there's some kind of warm fuzzy feeling from being part of the herd.  I'm sure you'll be happy with the service and maybe you got a better deal than we have."}, {"author_name": "AnonJr", "gravatar_hash": "428f62d7106d907001f1b3a7366b7820", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 11, 2009", "message": "Thank you for doing *something*.
