That is the purpose of the &lt;lastmod&gt; element, it tells google when the data was last changed so that google can ignore spidering unchanged content.\n\nYou can also use a lower &lt;changefreq&gt; for older content that hasnt changed. Old questions that havent changed in a month dont need to be spidered \u2018daily\u2019, consider using \u2018weekly\u2019 changefreq instead.\n\nAnother idea would to use E-tags"}, {"author_name": "Andrei Rinea", "gravatar_hash": "ea70b38ea893494ee0cd177adc0f54e5", "author_url": "http://blog.andrei.rinea.ro", "date": "Sep 02, 2009", "message": "I too, have a sick pleasure in deleting code :P I mean deleting code and keeping the same functionality :)"}, {"author_name": "Martin", "gravatar_hash": "96cc9a6a2199a0eff068448c5d16b2a3", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 03, 2009", "message": "Just to confirm,\n\nYes Monday was a bank holiday in the UK.

Water pitchers are designed for pouring water, not ice water. Pouring from the side results in more ice in the glass, and is faster. Pouring from the spout results in a jam of ice which results in only water going into the glass, slowly, though if the ice jam spontaneously breaks, unexpectedly fast. It takes only a little observation to figure this out."}]}
