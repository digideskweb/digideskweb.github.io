The reason why Craigslist is so dominant is precisely because it's free - if they start charging not only will they drive away 95% of the posters, but there will be massive growth of online classifieds that provide the same service and undercut Craigslist on price.\n\nIn other words, the existence of free online classifieds isn't due to Craigslist's generosity so much as a byproduct of the ubiquity of the internet. Fifty years ago you had to have a printing press (which the newspapers had) to publish classifieds. Now all you need is a website which can be set up, run, and maintained for a fraction of the cost.\n\nAnd why is it so hard to find people willing to pay the actual cost of a newspaper?

Well, at least from my viewpoint, that whole argument is twisted in so many dimensions it actually manages to open a quantum hole into a parallel world, where there's only abstractions of different dependence values floating around, where all concepts are reducded only to their potential for adjusting the international currency trade, and the ways in which it can be used to affect the world.

I have an ISV for medium size businesses and we have had to decide between 1) we install software on their machines, 2) SaaS, or 3) appliance model where we provide server with pre-installed software.\n\nCurrently we are with #1 but are probably moving towards #3 as we grow. #2 SaaS is not an option because our application stores customer data.\n\nYou had concerns about deploying StackExchange for the enterprise because of the following two reasons. \n\nFirst, you mentioned backups. This is a problem but what we've determined is that enterprise back office systems already have a robust backup strategy in place. Leave this to them. Whether they perform hot backups or cold backups or no backups, work with their admins initially for them to back up your appliance drives. They also might want you to store your DB files on their SAN or other storage device. \n\nSecond, you mentioned remote access. I disagree with the FogBugz server admin that says the company will not let you in. They have a robust remote access infrastructure in place -- that is how their own employees and other vendors access servers. They can set you up with a VPN profile (most likely a Cisco VPN) that only allows access to your box. This gives them tight control over your access to their back office. \n\nJeff mentioned that working with each enterprise customer in such a manner being a nightmare and this is true to an extent. Being an enterprise ISV versus other models is certainly a fundamental difference. When we first set out we wanted to sell hundreds of licenses. Now we find that slowly growing our customer base -- while at the same time nurturing each relationship with hands-on work -- works for us just fine.  Enterprise customers want their hands held more but they will pay for it and they are grateful, which gives us good job satisfaction. \n\nAs far as StackExchange for the enterprise goes I recommend treating it as a different business unit much like you have split StackOverflow and StackExchange. This type of work requires resources but can be quite fruitful. Breaking it off into a different business unit would isolate it nicely Remember some engineers love the solutions/support job description but some do not care for it. Here are some options:\n\nOne, create a FogBugz StackExchange services team that only supports the enterprise customer installations. This team would handle solutions work.\n\nTwo, partner with a company that specializes in enterprise software solutions. There are plenty.\n\nThree, sell this business unit to an company that would be the sole distributor for the enterprise business segment. It could be arranged so you would still get license revenue for their StackExchange installments. This completely hands it off to someone else for enterprise work.\n\nThere are just some ideas.

Craiglist is a opportunistic disease attacking someone with a terminal illness.\n\nThe problem with Craiglist is that you have this institution that is essentially a cult of personality. Peace, love, everythings free, blah blah man. The problem is that there's a real darkside to craigslist -- like it or not, the site is a hub for prostitution, spam is out of control and will remain out of control due to some philosophical position that Craig holds.\n\nAll cults of personality have a single point of failure. What happens when Craig decides that manually sifting through spam every day isn't fun anymore? Since the entire site is an expression of a single individual's whim, you're going to have the national resource for classified ads go poof someday."}, {"author_name": "PhantomTypist", "gravatar_hash": "bb54d41013255a7697a412d3e586c890", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 13, 2009", "message": "Pandincus and I have created a DevDays countdown app.  We have posted it as an answer to Joel's question over at Meta Stack Overflow.

Therefore, CIO are complaining about wasted resources, and IT is turning to virtualization to make them happy.\n\nWhat has working in the past is, A) a vendor supplied VM with all the goo in there (pre-configured) except for their outside dependancies, B) requirements documented for the database and a schema that can be installed, and C) a simple utility to configure the outside dependancies (database, SMTP, etc.)  This allows the IT organization the chance to use their SQL farms, managed by professionals, to host the critical part, and allows the IT orginization to follow their time-tested procedures and tools for things like backup / recovery, high availability and disaster recovery.\n\nJust my $.02"}, {"author_name": "Andrew", "gravatar_hash": "73a4e5331d141ee3a2221f3176981333", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 14, 2009", "message": "Does anyone have more info about what Joel said about Exchange needing to be installed on its own machine?"}, {"author_name": "Ralph Rickenbach", "gravatar_hash": "09eb3720b1c9d33bedd35a3bd47ec1c9", "author_url": "http://www.rickenba.ch", "date": "Sep 15, 2009", "message": "About not monetizing Craig's list: James 4:17 - http://bible.logos.com/passage/nasb/james 4.17"}, {"author_name": "Ralph Rickenbach", "gravatar_hash": "09eb3720b1c9d33bedd35a3bd47ec1c9", "author_url": "http://www.rickenba.ch", "date": "Sep 15, 2009", "message": "How I miss the edit function of SO.

I never even thought of Craigslist in this way, but I agree with you.

The post is at: http://www.eloquentspace.net/blog/amazon-kindle-free-press-2-0/\n\nMy hope is that the free press will become better as this transition from hard-copy to the web continues. I think bloggers will become better journalists, and hopefully some of the bias in the press dies off. On that note, I found it funny that you guys acted as if our press was so great right now, or even ten years ago! It's had a lot of problems for a long, long time. There's also some very aggressive bloggers out there posting their findings on all things political.\n\nIf anyone wants to drop me a line, feel free to do so.
