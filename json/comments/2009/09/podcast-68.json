The IP address range reserved for auto-assigned link-local IPv4 addresses is 169.254.*.* (or 169.254/16). See RFC 3927 (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3927.html) for details.\n\nRegarding Joel's question as to why it's useful - automatic address assignment was useful for the 'home' use case, where someone would put a bunch of Windows machines together on a LAN and would like them to simply discover eachother and work, without requiring any configuration or DHCP/DNS infrastructure. Automatically assigned addressing combined with NetBIOS discovery would allow this to happen. Zeroconf (a.k.a. Bonjour/Avahi) is the extension of this concept from machine discovery to service discovery: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroconf\n\nI'm confused by the problem Joel described with multiple NICs being registered in Active Directory's DNS structure. As he mentioned, in order for a NIC to 'choose' a link-local address, it must have attempted to obtain a dynamic address and failed. Why would this have happened in the case that your second NIC was unused? If left disconnected, the OS would never have considered the interface live or tried to obtain a dynamic address. Was the unused NIC plugged into a switch/hub that wasn't connected to the rest of the network?"}, {"author_name": "romandas", "gravatar_hash": "812cac3d389b39d59bab4d75f02c73f0", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 18, 2009", "message": "This may have been asked before, but Jeff, is it possible to have an additional RSS feed that contains ALL the podcast episodes instead of the latest 10?

Hope it's not bad form to post this as a comment to the podcast post.\n\n\n    Dear Joel and Jeff,\n\n    You lauched Server Fault for SysAdmins, but you admit to not knowing that crowd as well as you know the programming crowd. That\u2019s fine. But you need to find someone who does understand that crowd \u2014 and preferably already has the credibility you two have with programmers. Then you need to get him (or her) to co-host the podcast.\n\n    At the moment, your podcast does you no favours in promoting Server Fault: You constantly show little understanding of such things. The entire argument on hosting your own DNS on the most recent podcast is a perfect example.\n\n    I\u2019m sure nobody minds if you don\u2019t know everything, but to gain credibility for Server Fault, it needs a \u2019sponsor\u2019 that can join your team \u2014 at least on the podcast.\n\n    Cheers!\n    Rick Measham"}, {"author_name": "Mattias Lundmark", "gravatar_hash": "5d91fbab8aaae05f648ab9c60ebf215b", "author_url": "http://www.webusability.se/blog/", "date": "Sep 19, 2009", "message": "Is it just me that thinks that \"one-handed programming\" sounds a little... suspect? ;) I get all kinds of weird images in my head.
