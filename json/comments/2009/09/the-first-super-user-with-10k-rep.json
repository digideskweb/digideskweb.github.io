I have around 8k rep there and like 1 or 2 votes. I didn't notice until I had a few thousand rep that I haven't even been voting it sort of shocked me, now I find the account sort of unique and don't want to spoil it (talk about OCD, I don't know why though to be honest). There's over 10,000 other users on superuser though, I'm sure the community can pick out good answers without 1 persons help, there's enough people that sign up daily to cover my part tenfold at least."}]}
