I.e. the statement that \"there is a 95% chance that this number is in this interval I calculated\" is meaningless.\n\nKeep in mind that, even if you correctly understood what a confidence interval is, the votes you observe are neither random, nor independently picked out of the set of all votes for that question.\n\nI would be inclined to just divide the average vote by the standard deviation of the votes: 1 vote =&gt; infinite standard deviation =&gt; complete uncertainty."}, {"author_name": "Motti", "gravatar_hash": "6183c6f9d621a125cd3aa0f7ae324285", "author_url": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/3848/motti", "date": "Oct 24, 2009", "message": "The obvious way to reduce confusion with such ranking would be to display the percentage of people who liked/disliked a post.

Well, search ranking generally sucks, except for simple \"tag + keyword\"-based searches, where sorting by votes *generally* points me toward what i'm looking for on the first page or so.

Through some lovely math involving conjugate priors, you get the extremely complex formula:\n\np = (nUp + alpha) / (nDown + alpha + beta)\n\nYou can choose alpha and beta to match your application.  The fraction (alpha / (alpha + beta)) should be close to the overall fraction of ratings that are up.  The scale of alpha and beta indicates how strongly to weight the \"smoothing\" factor.  One common choice is alpha = 1 and beta = 1, which functions as one simulated up and down vote for every item."}]}
