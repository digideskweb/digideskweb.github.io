But $99 a year normally just seems silly. It doesn't sound like a \"nominal fee\" to me.\n\nAnd yes, you could argue that it's only something like $9 a month, to which I say \"no, it isn't\". Because if I put up my CV because I'm looking for a job, and, after a week, I get the offer of my dreams, then I've paid $99 for a week on the site.\n\nIf I'd been able to pay $9 a month, then I'd have only had to hand over $9 for the same week. $99 up front is a pretty big number for something that, according to this blog post, is only intended as a \"nominal fee\", to \"avoid the keyword-spam-free-resume ghetto\".\n\nFor that matter, wouldn't the same \"ghetto\" be kept away just as easily just by allowing potential employers to filter by rep? If they can choose only to see candidates with rep &gt; 5000, say, then you've already gotten rid of all the \"free resume\" half-arsed entries.\n\nTo be honest, it seems more like an attempt to monetize SO than anything else.

That is insulting.  \n\nYou could at least put in some threshold like 1000 hit points or something and another way to qualify resumes other than $29.\n\nAs you guys have pointed out in the past - putting a dollar amount on something like answering questions cheapens it and makes people feel dirty and used.  Placing a dollar amount in this manner also is the wrong way to go.\n\nI'd fix it if I were you."}, {"author_name": "tim", "gravatar_hash": "c3f783693e0a6dc68407a617d1a64864", "author_url": "http://www.stackoverthrow.com", "date": "Oct 13, 2009", "message": "In the spirit of \"monetizing\" the investment of time spent on SO, I am selling one of the two SO stickers I got from the Boston DevDays show.\n\nI figured that if I have to pay for my resume to be on SO and everyone else is doing a gold rush to make money on SO, I figured I might get back some of the investment I made.\n\nSo, highest bidder gets the sticker.

There's simply no need to charge. $99 is not a token fee.\n\nI find this especially frustrating when Coding Horror's latest blog refers to the developers of this feature being rewarded with expensive new SSDs for their troubles.
