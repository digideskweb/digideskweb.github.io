Allowing line breaks to be ignored in some cases is a function of Markdown's roots as an attempt to interpret \"ASCII conventions\", which really should read \"plaintext email conventions\".\n\nUsing the \"two spaces\" rule for paragraph text is painful, and should be made an exception. But the utility of it becomes obvious in blockquotes (in particular) and list items (to a much lesser extent).\n\nI would say it would be a better design decision overall to *only* apply the \"two spaces\" rule in blockquotes, and to only apply it where new lines are prefixed with the `&gt;` character (that is, inter-paragraph new lines within a blockquote should still be treated as new lines unless they are followed by `&gt;`).\n\nThis problem really bit me when I deployed Markdown Extra (which I'd already customized extensively) for an arts site where the users were accustomed to BBCode. That was probably a mistake in the first place, and I overestimated the value of Markdown's \"ease\". But it's absolutely a mistake to tell a poet that each new line in a stanza must end in two spaces.\n\nMarkdown is brilliant, but the \"two lines\" rule is a design flaw, and it could definitely be removed for wider adoption. As much as \"rich text\" editors continue to improve, I much prefer the control Markdown allows (and I think more \"regular users\" would agree if it was more intuitive*, because it's almost always a lot easier to *type* your **emphasis** than to press buttons or remember potentially unavailable keyboard shortcuts).\n\n* Another change that would probably help would be image and link syntax.
