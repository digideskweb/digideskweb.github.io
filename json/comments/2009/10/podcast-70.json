Everything about the design and philosophy of StackOverflow is anti-community and the thing is, it's not something they can fix because the very things that make it better than phpBB-style forums for Q&amp;A activity are the exact things that make it bad at community building.\n\nStackOverflow is designed to stay sharply on-topic and people are encouraged to read as little of it as necessary to get their answers. \"Google is our user-interface\" as Jeff said.\n\nCompare that to every forum I've been a part of that has felt like a community: People are encouraged to be around for a while before they even post new threads with questions and they are encouraged to stick about afterwards. Also, every single community, even if it had an overall subject, also had off-topic sections because there are no people who only ever talk about programming/motor-sport/music/etc. If you want to get to know other people (which is what community is really about), you have to talk about other things. \n\nA sharp example of this recently was on meta, where even though this is supposedly a more relaxed place for stackoverflow users, a Google Wave invitations exchange thread was rapidly closed as being off-topic. Every other forum I use (technical and non-technical) has a Wave invite thread going at the moment and StackOverflow won't even allow it on it's discussion site.\n\nNow you can dismiss what I'm saying because you're happy with StackOverflow as an effective way for programmers to exchange programming knowledge, which it is.

Also, this view seems to hold that if you have a PhD in Computer Science then you probably know less about CS than a Marketing major. And, on the other side, all that competency requires is knowing a few terms and reading blogs (if you're doing that, then, \"you've already won\").\n\nIf these views are seriously held as argued for in published books and popular blogs, particularly the former view, how can SO promote the careers piece without, at best, a heavy dose of cynicism?"}, {"author_name": "no one", "gravatar_hash": "5798bce88fb4f6ca62f075deb7ad1c9e", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 15, 2009", "message": "To continue with the pedantry:\n\nhttp://www.dailywritingtips.com/dissatisfied-unsatisfied/\n\n\nand\n\nhttp://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/dissatisfied"}, {"author_name": "JohnMcG", "gravatar_hash": "684937423429d5b6eceb9161dbe101fb", "author_url": "http://profiles.google.com/JohnMcG", "date": "Oct 15, 2009", "message": "OK, I get that the charge to post resumes isn't a greedy cash grab by Joel and Jeff so they can retire and count their money and laugh at how they suckered a \"community\" of devleopers into paying them for something that was free, and that it is a response to the legitimate requriement that to add be a value for employers, it has to present high-quality candidates.\n\nStill, I question it.\n\nAs a provider of a career website, the problem of filtering resumes to truly interested candidates is *your* problem.

My response is (if I were still single) I would rather go to the seediest singles bar than patronize the classiest call girl service.

(job seekers) \n\nI agree with John - Joel and Jeff basically punted on this one.  What we'll have then is people who are willing to pay money - not necessarily the best candidates or the ones who are willing to take a new job.  \n\nThere is an endless supply of evidence that desperate people will spend money to get jobs or on get-rich-quick schemes so the premise that this somehow \"qualifies\" people is dead wrong.  It may sound good when you're selling a recruiter on paying you $1000 to do a search and you can point at some of the brilliant people on SO, but if your real pool of $29 candidates is the ones right out of college or the ones recently laid off is that what you really want?  \nAs of this writing the last two posts by people who support it are two college kids just entering the job market.  Is that really the pool of qualified candidates you want to be selling?  I don't think so.\n\nIf you're making the market you can choose the rules.  In this case using money as the qualifier for \"serious\" job hunters is a mistake. \n\nIMO all the CVs should be searchable if it was elected and the candidates should have a set of criteria that they can present to recruiters so that neither side wastes time.\n\nOne should be able to define things like geographic areas, minimum salary, vacation, office space, CPU speed, only green M&amp;Ms in the receptionists desk jar, etc.  And this, my friends, is truly something that I would pay for.\n\nIf I could \"qualify\" only \"serious\" employers then I would pay $29.99 for that.
