Everyone should write a *lot* - whether it's a blog, a book, SO answers, emails or whatever. Write, and take some care over it. Clarifying your communication helps you to clarify your own internal thought processes, in my experience.\n\nIt's amazing how much you find you don't know when you try to explain something in detail to someone else. It can start a whole new process of discovery.\n\nJon"}, {"author_name": "macbirdie", "gravatar_hash": "c2ad4d98fcc9c454d09cbb16c6395a83", "author_url": "http://macbirdie.net", "date": "Oct 22, 2009", "message": "Jeff, please, stop with this \"non-web-app development is so retro\" nonsense already.

It seems to be sort of naive. All this time that has been spent improving clients has essentially been wasted if we stop using client applications altogether. There's not much need for gigs of memory or an increase in CPU power if all you're going to do is download and parse some HTML (ok, maybe you want the memory if you have poorly written browsers or Javascript, but performance is pointless anyway right?). I certainly don't see why these people would care about Windows 7 (and believe me, they *do*); aren't you baaically supposed to be using a dumb terminal that boots directly into a web browser?\n\nI guess I don't see the point in this view. Of course, there's this cliche that says \"people who don't see why everything should be done on the Web (or mobile, which seems sort of contradictory but all right) are just dumb dumbs that don't get social networking\" that we're all supposed to take as axiomatic at this point. \n\nHowever, I don't think this is really necessary. I see on Jeff's blog (but he is by no means the only one but stated some \"Atwood's Law\" or some such whatever) this idea that you can write any kind of app you want to be web based. Well, sure, I mean most of these languages are Turing complete, so you got me there. But what's the real motivation?\n\nThe primary party line is usually either 1) deployment and 2) portability. Deployment can be solved; in fact many have solved it. As for portability, if you're advocating Web centric dumb terminals then why would you care about OS portability anyway? But portability can be solved and has been solved by a few applications, not just using byte-code interpreted languages (although, that's really not a bad idea; you can't throw the baby out with early-Java's bathwater).\n\nEven further, the Internet is built on TCP/IP, which supports a lot more than just HTTP/HTTPS. It's just such a strange box to stay within. Does anyone think there might be some fundamental differences between an application and a hyperlinked document? It is not inconceivable to have an application delivery mechanism that is rich, portable, and supports a fairly simple deployment paradigm; actually there are some things like that - SecondLife, you can just ignore the \"Virtual World\" aspect of it and see that they have essentially achieved this without it even being the primary goal.\n\nIf in fifty years all we have in terms of software innovation is a couple new versions of HTML and a couple more \"rectangle\" plugins (as Joel and Jeff refer to them) then I think that would be somewhat sad and unnecessary, we certainly wouldn't be utilzing the vast computing power that we currently or will have."}, {"author_name": "steve", "gravatar_hash": "282eed17fcb9682bb2816697482b64ec", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 22, 2009", "message": "Love the podcast as usual - today though... i wish it was a VIDEO podcast! ;-)"}, {"author_name": "u62", "gravatar_hash": "221fc94982b5b7295f025c4386edb877", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 22, 2009", "message": "And this was the point I relised I don't need to listen to the Stackoverflow podcast any more..."}, {"author_name": "Donny V", "gravatar_hash": "67846ae2be88daca08dac5117c677305", "author_url": "http://donnyvblog.blogspot.com", "date": "Oct 22, 2009", "message": "The iPhone sounds like a nightmare to program for."}, {"author_name": "Robert", "gravatar_hash": "d538b5badf6dcba95f7b60a511104440", "author_url": "http://cubeantics.com", "date": "Oct 22, 2009", "message": "Nice!\n\nWhat did you guys use to record this audio?

Waite\n\nI don't think any of that makes much sense at all to be honest. \n\nYour position here suggests that the only reason to have spent all this money and time developing these powerful personal computers is so that a small, small minority of users (programmers) can run some virtual machines to test their Web applications. That's kind of silly.\n\nFirst of all, clearly in that situation all that research, development, etc was not worth it; the population of users is too small. Anyway, the second bit of this that doesn't make sense is that in the world where only Web programming (and to be pedantic, mobile programming), why would you need these virtual machines and all of these high powered solutions when all you want to do is verify the appearance and behavior of a HTML document from browser to browser? Surely, 1/100,000,000 (if not less) of the resources used to build the aforementioned things could have been used to solve that Web programmers can keep programming on the same dumb terminals that the vast majority of the users in this version of the world would be using. Of course, in such a World building operating systems such as Windows XP/Vista/7 would not be *at all* justified in terms of cost, usefuleness, etc so I don't see why IE 6/7/8 even matter since you would just have some dumb terminal, very basic OS for which the sole purpose is to allow the browsing of Web sites over TCP/IP and perhaps take in input (from Video cameras, etc) to be use in those Web browsers through those \"Rectangles\" that Joel, Jeff, et al are not fond of anyway (i.e. Flash on YouTube etc).\n\nAs for all this jibber jabber about \"if a programmer is not on a Mac then they are not cool enough to hang out with the 'web crowd',\" I'm not sure that your point there is at all intelligible. If all you need is a dumb terminal to do Web browsing then why would you need some complicated OS like the Mac OS X family? What does this nonsense have to do with anything?
