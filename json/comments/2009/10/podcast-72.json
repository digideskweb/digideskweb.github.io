Most decoders are 'bitstream compliant', which means that the decompressed output - that they produce from a given MP3 file - will be the same, within a specified degree of rounding tolerance, as the output specified mathematically in the ISO/IEC standard document (ISO/IEC 11172-3). Therefore, comparison of decoders is usually based on how computationally efficient they are (i.e., how much memory or CPU time they use in the decoding process).\"\n\n(from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3#Decoding_audio)\n\nEncoding, on the other hand, fits the description of being open for interpretation, as mentioned in the podcast:\n\n\"The MPEG-1 standard does not include a precise specification for an MP3 encoder...\"\n\n(from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3#Encoding_audio)\n\nSo different encoders encode the same original raw audio data differently, but all compliant decoders produce the same output audio stream, within an error tolerance.\n\nAnd finally, ask any audiophile about audio hardware, and they will tell you that what comes out of your speakers will definitely vary widely, and they can recommend some gold plated cables to help with that. ;-)\n\n(captcha: grant agitates)"}, {"author_name": "Jon Skeet", "gravatar_hash": "6d8ebb117e8d83d74ea95fbdd0f87e13", "author_url": "http://csharpindepth.com", "date": "Nov 02, 2009", "message": "@Jared: Thanks for the correction.
