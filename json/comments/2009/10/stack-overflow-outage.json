If the caps really catastrophically failed, the more interesting view is on the other side of the board. Even if that happened, the leads would not be burnt anyway. \n\nPer my original comment, I don't think this picture shows anything \"burned\" out. This seems to be the indication of a simple board rework or a hand soldering job during the original assembly that was never cleaned up. Hence my comment that the \"software/IT\" guys at the ISP have no idea what they are talking about or this is just dramatic obfuscation of what really happened.\n\nCertainly separate from the actual failure circumstances, there is no way that a single router failure at an ISP should take out the service completely. The story is fishy all around and I am not just talking about the fish oil contained in the electrolytic capacitors. :-)"}, {"author_name": "mgb", "gravatar_hash": "7010f170ec917b56e173f3978c459e0e", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 20, 2009", "message": "@George \nThanks I know that one - I just wondered if there was a dashboard style one that periodically checks top 10/100 sites"}, {"author_name": "Scott Hanselman", "gravatar_hash": "719c91f5c3013e43ee46ed2bdc67f883", "author_url": "http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselminutesOn9SpolskyAtwoodBlythHanselmanCrazyDeliciousContentFree.aspx", "date": "Oct 23, 2009", "message": "Ok, the <a href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselminutesOn9SpolskyAtwoodBlythHanselmanCrazyDeliciousContentFree.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"> video of this session is up at Channel9 now.</a>"}]}
