Who cares about the recession - is that your answer for telling people they should suck it up and live with a shitty job as well?  \n\nI'm not looking right now - I am too busy working on a new venture.  Once again for those who don't seem to be able to think for themselves : I was merely looking for answers to justify the business model of charging a significant fee (in spite of Jeff's hand waving about \"modest\") and to ask for more details about how they plan to bring the nirvana-like \"matches\" that they have gotten so giddy about.  \n\nAs another user posted a while back - Jeff and Joel have \"punted\" on the solution to a problem that is their problem - not ours - that is - how to justify the high cost to the employer side - specifically how to show that we are \"Serious\" about job seeking.  \n\nNever mind that all it takes is an automated email from the employer to gauge the interest.  A quick response (or lack of response) will solve that problem.  Jeff and Joel seem to think that it is easier to charge $100 to the candidates rather than have the employer write an email script, or, gasp, send an email manually to ask a candidate if they are interested.  Oh the horror.  How difficult is that?  \n\nI wouldn't be asking jeff and joel to vet the employers, except they have claimed that these employers represent the better companies - I want proof of that.  Again, THEY made the claim, I did not.  THEY want me to fork over money  - and don't seem to be willing to justify it other than saying that if I don't do it now then the price will go up (a tactic used by shady salesmen to put pressure on people to make decisions quickly).  \n\nYour 10,000 developer number gives a revenue for jeff and joel of about $290k.  That's some serious cash even in NYC, for what should be the smaller side of the equation.  Do you really think that is justified?  You don't think there there should be anything else offered for your $29 or $100? \n\nI sincerely hope that is not a realistic number - I would hope that more users than not have some sense to question the value of the $29 before just giving up/giving in and saying \"oh well, it's only a burger and a few drinks at TGI Fridays, they seem trustworthy and everything else they did was great.\"\n\nAre jeff and joel shutting down the other job posting sites on SO and on JOS?  \n\nDo you really think the that the only way/best way to winnow out the \"serious\" and best job seekers form the rest is $29 or $100?  There are many indications that this is just nonsense.  Not the least of which are people who HAVE ALREADY publicly stated that they did it just to get the \"low one-time offer\".  That sounds like it already broke the premise that all searchable users are \"prequalified\" and ready for action.  I can also imagine that there will a bunch of tire kickers regardless of the money spent on the \"job seeker\" side.  \n\nGiven that I have seen no discussion of these issues from them or acknowledgment that they had other ways to solve the problem of \"serious\" job seekers, I have little choice but to question the whole concept.\n\nBut, maybe the bottom line is that I am a cheapskate.  I mean, really, who the F%$$%#$ charges the job seekers for leads?  The answer I always come up with is \"scumbags\".
