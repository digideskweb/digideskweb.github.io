Advertising books failed. The new experiments are \\amazon affiliates\\ and \\pay to host a CV\\ and this is ok because the comunity loves the site and thinks this is all great.\n\nSo, how long til the community says \\whatever, we'll just pay you money directly because we want you guys to make a good living off of this site\\?\n\nStick up a \\pay $10 per year to get full use of the site\\ policy and you'll know exactly how much the community really loves you.\n\nThe most fun thing about this whole process is the repeated claims that SO isn't profitable (which is pertty much standard web 1.0, web 2.0, and web 3.0 business strategy) and the desperate dodging around the fact that all profitable companies sell a product or service in exchange for money.\n\nWhen SO started, I thought \\I could have done that, but I couldn't see any way to make money off it\\. Its nice to know I wasn't exactly wrong."}, {"author_name": "Ian Ringrose", "gravatar_hash": "699a9b2caefb52530d1c872bb2932d21", "author_url": null, "date": "Nov 18, 2009", "message": "Telling me about the \u201ctop\u201d books does not help me, as that is what Amazon tells me about when I go to their website.

I never click on ads but I will donate to a site if it helped me a great deal. I would donate $10. You will NEVER make anything close to $10 from books sale commissions from me.\n\nAs a developer and smart shopper I would go to Amazon and do an advanced search and filter by 'bestselling' and 'avg. customer review' and read the reviews. This happens when I am ready for a book and not when an ad popped up because I was on a site. Ads will never give the information I need. I consider them random, haphazard and a push to wasteful impulse shopping.\n\nOnce a book intrigues me because of Amazone good reviews, I check it out at a physical store and then maybe buy it at the spot or get from Amazon. Either way, I bypassed your affiliate link. Sorry, I just don't buy anything straight from an ad.
