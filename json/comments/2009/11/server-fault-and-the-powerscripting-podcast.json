I swear it actually manages to out-UNIX UNIX.\n\nThe merits of passing objects around in an interactive shell aside, \"mindlessly grepping text\" is one of the core concepts in Unix. From that point of view, an object-oriented shell is not very Unix-y at all. In fact, in so far as Unix tools are implemented as pure text filters, classic Unix shells can be seen as more of a functional programming environment than an object oriented one.\n\nThat said, I do enjoy a good OO irb (ruby-shell) session now and then, so I'm not going to pooh-pooh Powershell without having used it more than I have."}, {"author_name": "Barry Kelly", "gravatar_hash": "4a7b08fcb7e3d9a52ae473613b71bc3d", "author_url": "http://blog.barrkel.com/", "date": "Nov 24, 2009", "message": "One of the biggest advantages of a Unix shell, and one that PowerShell is missing, is job control.
