Right now I have no way to know if any of them are located in my area, what industries are represented, how many positions they are hiring for, how big they are, etc. I did sign-up and pay the introductory price a couple of months ago, but I feel like it's completely blind, because for all I know, every employer you have is hiring in the Northeast while I am in the Southwest and not willing to relocate. I'm trying it out as an experiment, but I would definitely not pay to renew without having a lot more info about the employers who are using the service."}, {"author_name": "Cletus", "gravatar_hash": "2f364c2e36b52bc80296cbf23da8b231", "author_url": "http://www.cforcoding.com", "date": "Dec 02, 2009", "message": "Wasn't the plan for it to be free to employers? I remember reading that it had a cost to job seekers to avoid the \"free CV ghetto\" syndromee.\n\nI also know that employers pay significant commissions to recruitment agents that can easily dwarf $5,000 for a year (often 10-15% of someone's annual salary as a commission, at least in the UK and Australia) but still $5,000 is a lot to pay to use a basically unproven Website for a year. I can't help but think that'll hurt uptake.\n\nAny sort of website like this lives or dies on achieving critical mass. It'll be interesting to see if it actually pans out.\n\nAlso, Joel once stated that for his job board there was no anonymity for employers. It seems that careers does have that (as I've seen no list or no plan to introduce one).\n\nAll in all, the whole thing is a little strange..."}, {"author_name": "Jeff Atwood", "gravatar_hash": "51d623f33f8b83095db84ff35e15dbe8", "author_url": "http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/", "date": "Dec 02, 2009", "message": "> Wasn\u2019t the plan for it to be free to employers\n\nNo, never.

This takes the power away from the employer, who is paying the larger sum of money to (presumably) anonymously filter a database of CVs without having all the noise of a rush of unsolicited CVs. This would harm employer uptake of the service.\n\nAs mgb points out there may be a compromise of information where the candidate could receive a general statistic of which geographical area or business domain their CV is generating interest in.
