However, I think it is hard to be a very proficient programmer without being proficient in C. Now, the same could probably be said for being proficient in functional language like LISP or Haskell. A proficient programmer shouldn't have a language crutch. However, I pick C specifically because it is such a fundamental language. You probably don't use any operating system that wasn't written in C or a C-like language (ok, the last bit is a jab at Windows/Microsoft).\n\nWithout understanding programming at the level of C, you may not really understand how the machine works. To be sure, you should have knowledge of assembly language programming but C provides a pretty good level of abstraction. To be honest, if a programmer has trouble understanding pointers then his problem is probably more to do with understanding *indirection*, which is fundamental. If the problem is with understanding how memory addresses work, then that programmer's knowledge is even more lacking.\n\nSure, understanding the fundamentals of database development is important and many people do not understand relational modeling enough. However, this is really high level stuff. Also, it may come as a suprise but there are many, many programmers that never deal with relational databases at all. It seems like database knowledge is more secondary to the fundamentals. Nevertheless, the two aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, most relational database management systems people **actually use** are written in C or perhaps C++, but not Java, C#, Python, Ruby, etc."}, {"author_name": "Jesse Hartwick", "gravatar_hash": "cfd1684ea3df74d506f58377b6da5a72", "author_url": "http://www,appscanadian.ca", "date": "Dec 16, 2009", "message": "\"all the backup talk in this podcast was recorded December 8th\"\n\nSo does this mean there's another podcast coming soon for this week, or are you going to be publishing on a one week lag from now on?\n\nI've got a non-shirt-worthy question that I'm thinking about recording, but I keep stopping myself (due to shyness and hatred of my own voice) so who knows.\n\nI love this podcast, keep up the great work!"}, {"author_name": "Richard Gadsden", "gravatar_hash": "3c291e7858e6b79e06889fa7dbf16d31", "author_url": "http://backtype.com/po8crg", "date": "Dec 17, 2009", "message": "\"What would the world we be like if employees who are 10 times more productive than their coworkers were paid 10 times as much?\"\n\nIt would be like sports, or other \"lottery\" professions (acting, writing, music, etc).

Acting and pop music pay on fame not on actual performance ability (that's why Britney's rich).
