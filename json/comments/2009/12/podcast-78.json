They had an autonomous tape robot. In case that the machine wouldn't boot, there was a boot block and a little operating system written to the beginning of the first tape, so that you could just plop the tape into a completely blank machine and it would boot and restore all by itself with no human intervention at all. Of course, they made sure that the SCSI HBAs they used had a BIOS so that you could boot from them. And they also made sure that the PC's BIOS supported booting from SCSI.\n\n...

FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT IS NOT DESIGN. HTML and CSS are not DESIGN languages, which is the subject of almost all of the questions. Design is about composition, form, color, line, texture, flow, interaction, timing, feedback, etc. Not how those things are implemented in a browser.\n\nObviously, a lot of Web designers know something about how to implement their visual and UI ideas using HTML, CSS and Javascript -- heck, some designers know a helluvalot about implementation, but I wouldn't say it's an automatic requirement implied by the title \"Web Designer\". \n\nJust had to get that off my chest.

While I don't know many controllers, I do know that some controllers (probably most?) add some metadata of their own to the bits, so if you controller dies you can't just take the disk and hook it up to the mainboard directly to recover the data. And if you can't get a new controller that is compatible with the bits on your disks and the rest of your environment (or you could, but not fast enough), then you're quite hosed."}]}
