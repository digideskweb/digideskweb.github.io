I was a pretty vocal critic of the fees.  I also think Joel was being extremely hypocritical with the \"special pricing\" windows.

Given the complaints and lack of growth I suspect they were forced to charge a more reasonable fee (though $0 is the correct fee)\n\nThe bogus argument of money \"qualifying\" candidates is so outrageous I can't believe they are still pushing that nonsense.    \nFor $99 for a lifetime the number is low enough that people just keep the bit flipped on all the time regardless of them being in the market or not.\n\nThe desperate people will pay any amount of money so they are a red herring.\n\nThe really good folks probably don't need SO and given that J&amp;J are not releasing details on the employers it is unlikely to entice another segment of people.
