At my company we do use them.  Although we typically ask the type of question that I think would not be super easy to \"just Google\" or post on stack overflow.

Sometimes there is noise in the source image -- also return embedded images that don't appear to be an exact match, but a probable match.  Define your criteria for a probable match.\n\n2) They email us their solution when they're done.    \n\n3) We take a look at it.  Try it.  See what are the interesting points to talk to the interviewee about.\n\n4) This gives us a chance to talk about algorithms and efficiency.  Also allows us to talk about software engineering.  Also allows us to talk about style.  \n\nIt has worked well.  While you do get a lot of people that you never hear from again.  Those we have heard back from tend to be quite strong.
