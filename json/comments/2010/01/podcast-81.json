To that end, rather than people checking in their changes, they each publish their own personal public repository (separate from their working repository) where their changes are available for others to pull in.\n\nIn a small project team, a golden list of changes could be maintained and each developer could assume responsibility of merging these changes into their working repositories. In this scenario, it is important for everyone to be aware of everyone else's public repository, and I assume this is what github is showing. (If I understood you correctly, github is showing everyone's repository, whether or not they have actually published changes. If this is the case, then I believe it would be nice to be able to filter out those who have not published any changes.)\n\nHowever, once the project team grows beyond a size where everyone can follow everyone else's work, it becomes useful to identify one person as an integrator and designate the integrator's working repository as the shared repository that all developers will synchronize with. Of course, as you described in the audiocast, anyone can pick and choose from all available changes and generate their own integrated repository that others can choose to synch with. The deliberately egalitarian philosophy behind git doesn't try to make one repository more special than another; any developer can assume the integrator role, either globally, or perhaps for a smaller team working on a specific feature, which after completed will be pushed out to a public repository to be picked up by the global integrator.\n\nIn the second scenario, it becomes less important to see everyone's public repositories, so long as you are happy with the job the integrator is doing. However, if you are not, then you would like to have everyone's repositories visible, so someone else more to your liking could take over the integrator role."}, {"author_name": "Isaac Lin", "gravatar_hash": "408975adb6e2f531f290e7fe0209a3a9", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 04, 2010", "message": "Regarding your concern about a fork implementing a feature you dislike: as you know, that's the double-edged sword of open source.
