Marc and Bill are good, but the sites need some fresh minds that have a sense of what the word 'moderation' means.\n\nThe nomination thread is a good example of why those people should not be moderators, and the fact that Jeff is the one who requested people to nominate themselves shows how little he understands about moderation.\n\nAnyone who nominates themselves as a moderator pretty much guarantees that they will be a horrible moderator. A moderator should always be reluctant to accept the job, and even more reluctant to use the moderation powers.\n\nThe only person on that thread so far that seems to grasp the moderation concept is:\n\n\u201cSO is self-regulating.
