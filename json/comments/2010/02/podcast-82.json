As much as I respect his technical prowess, and enjoy his provocative attitude,  I was squirming when he disparaged OS X's developer tools on stage. My impression was \"here's a guy who doesn't understand the tools and is blaming the tools instead of his ignorance.\" He was literally complaining live on stage about things that any experienced Mac developer would take him aside and say, \"you're doing it wrong, try this.\"\n\nSuch is the danger of being incredibly smart in one field or on one platform. It's tempting to make proclamations in other areas where your knowledge may not be as deep.\n\nYou'll probably remember on the podcast that I took care not to disparage Windows or Linux tools because I don't have enough exposure to them to make a fair judgement. While I love the Mac OS X tools and think it's highly likely that I'd find them superior to other platforms, I don't have enough experience with the other platforms to declare them inferior.\n\nDaniel"}, {"author_name": "Duncan", "gravatar_hash": "c705c1d246a9887cbe656dd870a9537a", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 06, 2010", "message": "Thanks for clarifying.\n\nI think positive feelings about Windows / .NET development can often boil down to 'Goddamn, I really like Visual Studio'.

He's a smart, smart guy who has deep experience on both sides.\n\nhttp://is.gd/7RIi7\n\nSo when he refers to Objective C as \"a language that left the Nerd Womb suckling a can of New Coke while watching Max Headroom\", I'd have to concur, based on the DevDays demos I saw.

Anyway, I'm a fast typist, and it doesn't slow me down too much.\n\nObjC is a perfect language for Apple because it's a constraints-oriented language.
