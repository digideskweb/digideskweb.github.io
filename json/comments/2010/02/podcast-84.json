I think a few things are obvious:\n\n0. Sales. The mere existence of Stack Exchange isn't going to get the huge number of various individually owned and operated forums out there using phpbb or vbulletin to switch over. It'll take sales people making calls and making deals. Some of this may involve converting companies to Stack Exchange accounts, some of it will have to involve selling shrinkwrapped versions of the SO software. As examples, think about the forum software in use by, say, Toshiba, Seagate, or Lenovo.\n\n1. Expand the Q&amp;A trilogy. Create more wholly owned and operated sites in new fields. Stack Exchange shows the potential here and there obviously isn't any team more familiar with how to grow sites of this sort than the SO team, but there are lots of genres where they don't have the domain knowledge and can't provide that helpful initial injection of core users to kick-start the site. With VC they'll be able to create new sites and bring on outside \"talent\" to manage these sites. Also, Stack Exchange creates a potential channel for them to identify promising sites of this sort that they might buy out and manage directly.\n\nKeep in mind that SO.com manages to keep in the black on ad revenue alone despite the fact that programmers and techies are some of the hardest people to advertise to, the ad revenue on a site with almost any other topic would almost certainly be higher for the same traffic levels.\n\n2. Expand the careers / jobs sites. Jobs listings are a natural complement to any high-traffic, narrow focus site. And the careers site is a disruptive idea that could have a seriously ludicrous amount of growth potential, and also naturally meshes with a karma / achievement oriented tight focus knowledge exchange type site.\n\nIn short, imagine 10s, 100s, 1000s, etc. of different Q&amp;A sites out there using the SO software. On subjects ranging from AV gear, to automotive maintenance, to amateur astronomy, to knitting, to vegetarian cooking. Many of these sites (the professional ones at least) with appropriately targeted jobs and careers sites. All of them funneling licensing, ad, and/or job listing/search revenue into Stack Overflow Inc.\n\nThat's a big proposition, and probably something that will require VC, but the idea that SO software can serve as a foundation for this particular business prospect is enormously sensible.\n\nDo I get some sort of prize for apparently being the only one able to figure out something seemingly so immensely obvious?"}, {"author_name": "Zack", "gravatar_hash": "a27764e5c0529d03018cba073e612c3a", "author_url": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/83/zack", "date": "Feb 23, 2010", "message": "Wedge is right.

Yet when Joel announces that he wants to pursue VC for Stack Overflow there is this tremendous criticism (here and elsewhere) of his decision, much of it focused on questioning why he would need VC at all for nothing more than a dinky old programming q&amp;a site. Anyone who has been paying attention, has any degree of business sense, and spent the time to actually think about it shouldn't have trouble imagining why Stack Overflow might need an infusion of capital in order for their software to replace every single existing instance of a web-based forum in the entire world (one of their stated goals, though a bit lofty).
