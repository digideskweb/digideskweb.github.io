So far there were a few problems I stumbled over which yielded that result. Might be that the questions are lousily asked or unclear, though.\n\nStill, the majority of answers I provide fall into two areas:\n\n1. Basic knowledge of the domain.\n2. Common errors of the domain.\n\nGood and interesting questions (to me at least\u2013other's mileage may vary here) are quite rare and to that end I find it unfortunate that good questions aren't highlighted anymore in the podcast (or the accompanying blog post; never listened to the podcast because it's audio-only [until the transcript is up, by the time I have forgotten about it] which to me is pretty much the worst medium for getting information across)."}, {"author_name": "Shaun Finglas", "gravatar_hash": "5fa64738b2b35539637c51e7a098587b", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 11, 2010", "message": "\\Interestingly the members of other sites based on the the engine (I am talking about mathoverflow here) don\u2019t share the same values \u2013 I did ask a few newbie questions and I got nasty comments and downvotes.\\\n\nI had the exact issue.

To give examples: I've had some of my questions closed, some without justification (in my opinion;).  When I asked for reasons, one was \"I'm not interested in hearing the answer to this question\".  Or - having my posts edited, where the edited version is no improvement, just a sylistical re-write.
