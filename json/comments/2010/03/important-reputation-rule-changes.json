Assume that in the future someone's rep will be recalculated.  The question really is whether or not the current rules are applied to their historical data or whether the recalculation rules need to take into account the rules as they existed at the time.  The former is undoubtedly much simpler to implement and maintain.  The latter would require some sort of strategy pattern and selecting the proper strategy based on the date for the particular action.  Theoretically the former might be done as a single (albeit complex) SQL statement.   The latter would require at least a series of statements -- one per rule set -- over subsets of the data.  I think the fairest thing for existing users is to either never do a recalculation at all (not likely) or use the complex calculation logic that applies different rules sets.    The fairest thing from the perspective of future users (and the devs) is probably to apply the rules retroactively to put every one on a level playing field.  In the end, there is probably no solution that satisfies everyone and I default to the simplest.\n\nAnother (out of the box) alternative would be to refactor the game entirely so that's really multiple games.  We've discussed this before but the conclusion was that it probably wouldn't affect the ordering all that much, so why bother.  Now there's an additional reason -- you can change the rules for the new game, while leaving the old game intact.  Rep then becomes your score in the current game and you keep track of your position/score in previous games as an overall rep.  Privileges are granted once you achieve a minimum score in any game and are never lost.\n\nThis solves the problem that you never get the rules right the first (or second) time you design a game.  Usually this isn't an issue because the games are short and you simply start over with better rules the next time.  Unfortunately, SO is a \"forever\" game at this point and refining the rules while playing does seem like \"cheating.\""}, {"author_name": "Stephen", "gravatar_hash": "282eed17fcb9682bb2816697482b64ec", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 19, 2010", "message": "We don't lose rep on community wiki upvotes do we?\n\ne.g. I have a question that is CW... if it gained 2 upvotes (in a CW state) (e.g. I got no rep from it) that will be excluded from the retroactive (-5 * 2upvotes) = -10rep... right?\n\nI can't recall if SO keeps track of whether upvotes/downvotes were given before/after CW status or if it just keeps a running total."}, {"author_name": "Joni", "gravatar_hash": "0bd656eb14c50299b2744f80e69459bf", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 19, 2010", "message": "I've got 3090 rep.
