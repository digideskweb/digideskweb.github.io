Anyone in the public eye will have their detractors, warranted or not.\n\n(1) is key here. Jason gives something to budding entrepreneurs. So the question should be: what can you and Jeff give to the SO (or broader SO/SU/SF) community via the podcast?

I did dip into a couple just recently but there's not much on offer to hold my attention, which is a shame because it was one of my top 5 podcasts.\n\nI think you need more guests to liven things up and to vary the content, two folks who work together, batting back and forth their own opinions, does not an interesting podcast make. Having a third or fourth person on the call for different opinions/viewpoints (we've heard all of Jeff's now [twice] :) ) would be way more interesting.\n\nI agree with the \"less about programmers\" (I find this whole putting programmers up on pillars of gold/celeb thing we do in this industry distinctly disturbing and makes me queezy), but I don't think there's any harm in maintaining content \"about programming\". For example, would the trendy NoSQL databases appearing recently be a viable option for Stack Overflow (and have a guest that knows the subject well come on the show to discuss?).\n\nI'd also like to hear more about the ongoing challenges of running the Stack Overflow sites and a lots more details about the underlying technology stack and how you've used it, and how you've had to change things over time to accommodate increased traffic, bad behaviour etc. Also what the thoughts are wrt the upcoming VS2010/.NET 4 release, how will that impact the team, do they feel the irresistible desire to upgrade...\n\nI'd also like to hear less about the process of blogging, jeez guys, if you've raked that set of coals once you've raked it a hundred times. Your stuff is either interesting &amp; relevant, or it's not. How you got there, I don't really care. OT: Jeff also needs to re-learn blogging because he's blogging like a \"blogger\" these days and not like a programmer any more, but I think that's maybe an overall symptom of the current SO podcast situation.\n\nOne podcast I enjoy every month is the Herding Code podcast. Whilst they seem fairly ad-hoc, there's clearly a fair bit of prep gone into each programme. This doesn't seem to be the case with the present SO podcast which oft-times wanders off into a Joel or Jeff navel gaze session.\n\nI know you guys can do better, but on a final note. A few years back I did a radio show, it was fun and I wasn't locked into a station playlist. I did it for the music and to get tunes out there that no-one was getting the opportunity to listen to. I did this for two years, then suddenly it was a drag, my heart wasn't in it, and so I stopped rather than drag the listeners down too. Every now and again I feel like spinning disks again. Maybe the podcast/bloggy thing has gone the same road, it feels like that just now. So why not take a break and just put something up there when you've got something interesting to broadcast instead of being beholden to a strict monthly schedule and subject matter is thin on the ground?"}, {"author_name": "Goyuix", "gravatar_hash": "846aeb3494a51fdd2af2bb0b99dc364c", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 14, 2010", "message": "Two things I LOVE about this podcast:\n\n* Discussing the development and changes to the StackOverflow engine including the challenges that face the team and how they end up being addressed.\n\n* The guests.

One way to do this is guest interviews, which I love and you already mentioned you are going to do more of. Another way is to talk about the news - this is what many podcasters do. Every week gather a list of items from your news/CSS feeds, and talk about them."}, {"author_name": "David", "gravatar_hash": "8c76979fc8c7453cea6af9643954d7f7", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 31, 2010", "message": "I would like to hear more about the real world problems and solutions of running a top 1000 web site.

I work on a programming project that controls and works with the IP based radio station equipment Leo Laporte just put in.  So if you are serious we may be able to help.  But my advice would be to forget the gear and outsource the production to someone like us so all you have to worry about is dialing in, and somebody else gets to worry about levels/editing/etc.  Give us a call if you are interested.\n\nThe more you can do on programming concepts with specific examples and the less on Stack overflow the better.

And I can't get enough of it.  It is interesting, entertaining, funny, sad at times, and everything else.\n\nThe reason it's so interesting to me is because it is real life people calling in to talk about real life problems that I myself could be having.  I love hearing somebody call in with a similar situation as mine and hearing what Dave has to say about it.\n\nOn the Stack Overflow Podcasts, there are the \"Listener Questions\" where you hear about people's real life problems as well.  However, you only get to hear a pre-recorded question and you don't get to hear what the person asking the question thinks about the answer, maybe further clarification of the question, etc., etc.  \n\nOnce you hear the question, you get to hear what Joel and Jeff think about whatever subject was brought up.  These are the most interesting moments of the podcast for me, especially when I can relate to the topic.  \n\nAnd so, I propose a Podcast Format where a caller calls in to ask a question and Joel and Jeff talk with the caller and have a dialog with them.  Without going as far as actually broadcasting LIVE on the radio, I believe this is technically possible.\n\nIt's basically Q&amp;A with Jeff and Joel and since StackOverflow is a Q&amp;A site I think it fits..."}, {"author_name": "Andrew R.", "gravatar_hash": "519f51ec8eafd71703f9698c330fa757", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 15, 2010", "message": "Whatever you do guys, hurry up!\nI need new episodes to make my commute enjoyable again,\nand as motivation to create something good for the world myself.\nKeep it up!"}, {"author_name": "phil colbourn", "gravatar_hash": "cd2ea9a49f4d261c83eda340ac0326fe", "author_url": "http://philatwarrimoo.blogspot.com", "date": "Apr 17, 2010", "message": "I like the current format and how it has slowly changed over time.\n\nMy fear of a new/different format would be like if Get Smart changed their format - it might be good, but would I be happy with it?\n\nIt will still be Jeff and Joel won't it?\n\nI will say 'Thanks for the podcast and all you and your teams efforts.' - 'cause I might not care to thank you if I don't like the new format. \n\nWhen CUSTOMers move away they don't often let you know why."}, {"author_name": "phil colbourn", "gravatar_hash": "cd2ea9a49f4d261c83eda340ac0326fe", "author_url": "http://philatwarrimoo.blogspot.com", "date": "Apr 17, 2010", "message": "One more thing...\n\nPlease entertain."}, {"author_name": "systempuntoout", "gravatar_hash": "97b24d533eab5a093a1085903745b33c", "author_url": "http://www.systempuntoout.com", "date": "Jan 10, 2011", "message": "I love that format, it does not need any changes in my opinion.\nYou are really great and the podcast was interesting, funny and entertaining, period.\nThere are a tons of new cool things happened to Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange to talk about.\nPlease start it again."}]}
