In particular, why not leave this proposal in place for a little while on meta to collect yet more discussion?  Why so quick to implement?\n\nThis is a long-standing question on meta: why do some planned features languish for months while others are implemented nearly immediately?  For the most part, the answer was that small changes need less discussion than large ones.  But this was a huge change... so it's odd that the specifics of one huge change sat around for 9 months of discussion before being tabled, while the specifics of this huge change (the mechanics of which are different from anything that was on previously the table) were discussed for less than 24 hours.\n\nAgain, I like the change, and I am not one of those shell-shocked by it.

Here it is.  \n\nRep is important.  It has always been important.  Both Jeff and Joel have assigned special privileges to rep thus proving that even THEY think it is important.  To show just how important they think that rep is they have even gone so far as giving very high rep score users a great deal of special privileges on the site.  I don't think that any of that can be reasonably disputed.  Rep is important.  I also hold this opinion.\n\nI was first involved with SO very early on in its development; my user id is 730 (I have both a beta and yearling badge).  When Careers started up, I paid to have my cv published and have been putting my cv link on ALL my job correspondence.  That may not seem a big deal, but as I have been out of work since mid-November and only recently picked up a three-month contract just this month, it's been circulated a great deal.  There is an important point to make here about SO and Career's; the rep score is prominently displayed on the CV and my score of 2085 is a very good rep (that puts me in the top 2% of all SO users).  I say all of that to establish two things: \n\n1. I am no \"johnny-jump-the-internet-troll-bandwagon-lately\" for the sake of a cause to be angry about.\n2. I am vested in this family of sites more than most.  I've been here a long time and I've put actual money into it.\n\nWhen I was granted access to the beta site, I was tasked by Jeff and Joel to start seeding the site with questions.  We all were; they said they needed a critical mass of questions to help people start getting to the site.  So I (we) did.  I had put up some 36 questions and 73 answers (and numerous comments).  I have 47 badges (which include the Taxonomist and Disciplined badges).  So, how much did I lose?  Right at 500 points; 25% of my rep.  So, now I sit at 1584.  Not a bad rep; still in that top 2% of all users.  But, all my resumes that have been sent out over the past three months show my rep right at about 2000.  Yes, I can tell people there was a large adjustment in the rep scores this week...If they ask me...Or, if the look at the SO blog....But, I think we both know what they are going to be thinking.  \"My, my, I guess you thought I was too stupid to check you score, huh.\"  \"Well, Mr. Not-Gonna-Work-Here, I don't have time for people who make spelling mistakes on their resume and I DON'T have time for people who LIE on their resumes.\"  Well, maybe they will and maybe they won't; I'll never know...and neither will you.  They'll just move right on past and I'll never get a chance to explain why I sent them an inflated figure.  Simply put, Jeff and Joel asked me to seed the site and I did and now they've taken back what they 'paid' me because they think they are currently 'paying' too much.  \n\nI think that it would have been fair to change the values for the questions going forward not retroactively.  That sort of retroactive-scope change may start to make a person think where else their hard work may be devalued in the future.  It may make me a person think, \"oh yes, he'll give me 10 points an answer now, but next year he may think that he wants to discourage someone from going through and marking three or four of the ten answers on a question as good and so only allow 5 points for the third or fourth question that particular person marked up on that particular question.\"\n\nI wish you would reconsider this again and give back what you said you would give us for the questions.  You can of course re-negotiate what you will 'pay' for the future and that seems fair but reaching backwards to take what's been earned may have a chilling effect that you'd want to discourage as well.\n\nword verification:mammas region\nI'm uncomfortable with that....80)"}, {"author_name": "Jeff Atwood", "gravatar_hash": "51d623f33f8b83095db84ff35e15dbe8", "author_url": "http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/", "date": "Mar 25, 2010", "message": "> But the idea to half all question points was not from meta (at least as far as I could see).

They then re-calculate every players\u2019 point total to reflect what they would have scored if the 3-point line was in place.\"\n\nSounds perfect. Why wouldn't they do that if only it was practically possible? The statistics are supposed to help you compare players, so it would be crazy to NOT make such changes retroactively recalculated if you had the ability. To not do so would make the numbers almost meaningless for years, if they are supposed to help you predict how a player will perform in the future. This is a very good analogy with SO, well done! :)\n\n\"The government lowers the speed limit on a road. They then issue speeding tickets to people who exceeded the new speeding limit before the change.\"\n\nAnd speeding tickets represent fines, which represents dipping into people's bank accounts to punish them. But SO reputation is not money. See above. Other people are \"stealing\" the value of your reputation score every second! Every time I upvote someone else, I create a unit of SO rep value, out of thin air, causing inflation, and thus damaging the relative value of everyone else's reputation score. SO reputation simply does not represent an absolute value that you've accumulated and that no one has the right to take away from you. It's shrinking in value all the time.\n\n\"For me, what the recalc underscores is that the reputation scores are just an arbitrary number\"\n\nNo, you have it backwards. If the recalc had not been retrospective, everyone's rep would have included an arbitrary historical error rendering them all meaningless until there was enough rep-inflation to make the error insignificant (which would probably take a few years).\n\nIf rep scores were protected individual property, they would be like money: not much use as an indicator of how helpful or knowledgeable a person is.\n\nIt is a fact of life that we need some thing to represent protected individual private wealth, *but we already have money for that*. SO reputation is for a *different* purpose."}, {"author_name": "JohnMcG", "gravatar_hash": "684937423429d5b6eceb9161dbe101fb", "author_url": "http://profiles.google.com/JohnMcG", "date": "Apr 01, 2010", "message": "I'm aware that reputation scores aren't money.\n\nBut they are, in a sense, compensation for one's contributions to the site.

Fine.\n\nBut, I think it's damaging to the credibility of the metric.  And yes, I think it would be damaging to go back and re-calculate athletes' statistical totals every time the rules change.  They're a measure of how effective players were in that context.  Retroactively applying a different context makes those accomplishments meaningless.  \n\nMany programming tasks that were very difficult years ago are easy today.  Should we thus downgrade our opinion of earlier developers?  Of course not.\n\n---\n\nObviously Jeff has the \"right\" to do whatever he wants with our reputation scores (though as I said above, acting in such a capricious manner belies the \"it's all about the awesome community\" rhetoric we've been treated too.).\n\nI'm just relaying my reaction that doing this undermines my confidence in the reputation scores, and makes it a less attractive incentive for me to contribute to the site.
