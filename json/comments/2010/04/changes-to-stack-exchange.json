I like the idea of having a community-supported mechanism for getting StackOverflow to create, support, and build new community sites that everyone seems to vote on and enjoy... but why the heck not keep StackExchange functional exactly like it was pitched?\n\nThe flipside of this is: as a podcast listener, I was really on board with your (Jeff) vision of StackOverflow being our (programmers) community hosted, run, and monetized by you. But early on, you stated that one of your goals would be to release the source code as open source. I agreed with this vision and found it easy to support you.\n\nThen, sometime around episode 40 or so, when you and Joel were discussing StackExchange, you mentioned Open Sourcing the codebase and he instantly shot it down. His argument was that you can't give away the source code to the product that Fog Creek was going to offer hosted solutions for. I disagreed with his arguments completely, but he seemed to have the final say in the matter because from that point on, Open Sourcing was off the table.\n\nBut even that wasn't that bad, because I understand the monetary implications for Fog Creek. I can't fault him for wanting to make a buck. But now that Fog Creek is no longer offering hosted solutions as was originally intended, then I think releasing the source code should be your goal again.\n\nDoing so would make your arguments of ownership less ridiculous. Sure, you offer these nice data dumps, but with no system in place to read and host the data dumps, it's almost worthless.\n\nSo, I think you need to re-evaluate what it is you're doing to the community of supporters that you guys have created. You seem to be on a streak of pretty lousy decisions. If a company or group wants to pay $100+/month for you to host a StackExchange site with only 3 users, you should be super happy. That's basically free money for you with less bandwidth overhead and data storage requirements.

We don't care that they have to try a lot of different things. We don't care if they consider things a failure. We're (or at the very least just me) concerned that Joel and Jeff have built a community (which we VERY much appreciate) and then pitched a commercial product to us based on the infrastructure of the community and then got some early customers and for whatever reason decide they didn't like going down that path.\n\nIt would be OK with me if they decided to change and kept both \"pathways\" running at the same time. Let the current users continue (or heck: begin) to pay for the SE service while running the voting mechanism for sites that StackOverflow want to own.\n\nIt would have also been OK if from the very beginning they told us \"We will always be willing to give you all of your data, but you'll never get our source code\" because I would have happily just started writing a similar system that could read their data. Maybe PHPOverflow or something.\n\nThere are just about 101 different things they could have done at different times in the past year that would have made this not as big of an issue.\n\nBut at this stage of the game? They're basically telling us \"We're willing to change our minds at any time about anything.\" \n\nAbsolutely NOTHING is offlimits to them. \n\nThis is an extreme example and is probably NEVER going to happen, but just imagine if in a year Jeff and Joel decide \"Stack Overflow isn't making enough money to cover our costs. We should institute a 'premium member' package.\"\n\nA week ago, I would have said \"Sweet! Joel and Jeff have always been up front with us before. This is good news.\" and then go pay them to upgrade my account. Because, after all, Joel and Jeff made SO specifically because they hated Experts-Exchange (for good reason).\n\nHowever, this blog post signifies a new era in \"StackOverflow\". It's basically the era of \"we are now willing to do anything we want at any time in the interest of profit.\"\n\nThat might not even be true. But it's certainly how I (and probably others) perceive this. So in my extreme example given about premium accounts, I now have serious doubts that at some point in that future timeline that maybe not enough people are signing up for premium accounts and Joel and Jeff decide \"Hey, let's try to restrict some of this content to premium members only to increase conversions.\"\n\nAnd blam, now SO is Experts-Exchange. \n\nSo yeah, I think we have a right to be concerned, at the very least. The way a company makes decisions on small things (like new products offered for free during a beta period) is an indicator of how they might be willing to make decisions on bigger issues.\n\nI'm also aware that SE was in \"beta\" and that nothing was \"set in stone\", so really all of the people that had a Stack Exchange site maybe shouldn't be surprised. But I think Joel and Jeff should have a little bit more internet-common sense about what \"Beta\" means to people these days. These days beta means \"Some things may be broken, and we may or may not be able to fix those things. We might also make significant changes in how a thing looks or how it physically functions.\" \n\nBeta has not meant \"we're going to test the waters with a product on a large number of users to see if the product is viable, and if not, completely take it away.\" Most people willing to make a StackExchange site probably expected things to change, but the last thing they expected was for StackExchange to stop being a thing they could actually use."}, {"author_name": "sam", "gravatar_hash": "3dcae8378d46c244172a115c28ca49ce", "author_url": "http://community-tracker.com", "date": "Apr 15, 2010", "message": "Re: Eric\n&gt; It would be OK with me if they decided to change and kept  both\u201cpathways\u201d running at the same time.

At least now its clear they are both under the same umbrella. \n\n-  It was clear by looking at traffic and number of SE sites that starting to charge would not cover hosting + salary for 3 devs. \n\nFor me the change is way more inline with the original SO spirit. \n\nI think that plenty of products will pop up to cater for companies that need support portals, in fact, I think I do a better job at customer support (where Q&amp;A is a component, the community is smaller, you need a KB and better means of messaging) and would welcome fog creek as customers :)"}, {"author_name": "Eric Ryan Harrison", "gravatar_hash": "84d9c06ad23348c26556512289dfe6a4", "author_url": "http://ericharrison.info", "date": "Apr 15, 2010", "message": "Sam: You make valid points and I agree with you that SE as a model doesn't fit as nicely with SO (as a tech platform). I would have preferred they keep with the initial plan of just Open Sourcing it. But I still think that getting rid of a hosted service when they've already got people using the hosted service is just bad for everyone.\n\nA hosted solution is PERFECT for a company (profitable already) that wants to use the StackOverflow for private internal use or for a front-facing customer service community. Companies would probably not care about the price if it was easy to use and had a good clean interface for their users.\n\nThe problems you mention with SE sites putting ads all over the place is an example of the failed marketing of SE. Instead of a bunch of people saying \"I want to build a SE community around topic X, but I need to find a way to monetize it to pay the monthly costs\", I think it should have been marketed as \"If you have an existing product or service, here is a hosted version that you can pay us to run for you.\" Those entities would be using the platform as a support driver instead of a potential profit source. \n\nI think SO would excel in that sort of situation and SE could be a profitable business model in those situations. And the super-delux package with local hosting of a pre-built machine fits well in that model. Your bigger enterprisey customers (like the government) would have no problem with that huge price point if they could put the box in their datacenters. I think the model was viable.\n\nWhat was broken was the marketing. It should have never been pitched to the SO community as \"Come build a StackOverflow-like site for any topic you want\" \n\nAnd you're absolutely correct that there are better companies providing better software for customer support and things of that nature. But there aren't a lot that work like StackOverflow (excluding all the clones). There were a lot of mistakes made all around, but I still think it's worse for StackExchange, StackOverflow and Fog Creek in the long run to terminate the \"StackExchange\" concept in mid-stride.
