One of the best qualities of SO, in my opinion, is that it's not a \"community\" in the usual web community sense. There aren't cliques or ruling elites or people talking behinds each others backs, or any of the other social cruft that comes with communities.\nThere aren't groups of friends who *always* come to each others aid in comment discussions.\n\nStackOverflow is a strictly businesslike phenomenon. I don't go there to talk to my pals, I go there to ask and answer programming questions. And while I have gotten to know a number of people in this way, it's happened by noticing their answers, checking their profile, and from there, finding a link to a blog or twitter profile, not by chatting to them about our hobbies.\n\nOne of the things that makes the site so approachable is that it's not a tight-knit group of friends. You don't feel like a newcomer or intruder when you sign up, because there never was any chat/getting to know each others/socializing going on that you could have missed out on. If you introduce a social dimension, you're effectively creating another aspect for us to keep up with if we want to stay in the loop. Suddenly it's not just about what amazing answer Jon Skeet wrote yesterday, but also what he wrote in thread X on the social subsite.\n\nThe last thing I want to see is SO become fully self-sufficient. I don't want it to become a bubble world completely isolated from the rest of the internet. I think it's better to openly say \"if you want to chat to your pals, take it to Twitter or Facebook or a forum or IRC or whatever else you can think of\".\n\nI think such a social subsite is at best unnecessary, and at worst, counterproductive and harmful.\n\nIt might work for individual SE sites, but I'm not sure, and it'd have to be enabled on a per-site basis.\n\nThe meta site was different because it served a need that could not be fulfilled elsewhere.

It is simply the OT space. And OT != \"anything goes\" or \"free for all.\"\n\nMy biggest concern for OTish spaces in a pure-tech environment, though, are that they can so easily deteriorate in unimaginable ways. (At least unimaginable for many geeks.) I think both Jimmy Wales and Craig Newmark once agreed that if you think *political* topics are emotionally charged, that's NOTHING compared to the discussions on... *pets*.\n\nSo, you know, moderation and clear cultural standards, etc.\n\nAnd by the way, when it's time for horseoverflow, I'm so there."}, {"author_name": "Evan", "gravatar_hash": "9798931483c6fe5af55ec68698ffd0a0", "author_url": null, "date": "May 09, 2010", "message": "How about chatroulette.unicornoverflow.com\n\nThen you'd have the largest online chat sausagefest with nothing but old hairy guys showing their members... :)\n\nIn all seriousness. Live chat isn't needed for answer threads because the inline comment system accomplishes the revision process well enough as is.\n\nJeff, if you're looking for a medium to connect with other developers. Add social identities to the user profile section to open up lines of communication.\n\nJust plug in the twitter API. Displaying user's full twitter feed might add a lot of unnecessary fluff. So it would be beneficial to look into tweet filtering. I know it can be done already, I just don't think anybody has done it well yet.\n\nThink along the lines of how people filter gmail messages username+filter@gmail.com. I don't know if it would be possible to do the same in twitter.\n\nIt seems ridiculous that people attach all unrelated streams to one identity without filtering. In the 'real world' we naturally live multi-faceted lives and compartmentalize domain specific details automatically. I'd call this the #1 reason Web 2.0 is still socially retarded.\n\nWhatever you do, don't clone twitter. That would defeat the purpose of shared identities (and the reasons why you guys use OpenID as the main ACL mechanism in SO).\n\nIf you want general chatrooms, just create some IRC channels. I know most *doze devs don't understand IRC and that sucks. But the risks (wasted time) of writing a chat platform outweight the benifits (free mature and easily deployable) of using IRC.\n\nI know Joel and Jeff are MS fanbois to the extreme so please, no derisive snorts.
