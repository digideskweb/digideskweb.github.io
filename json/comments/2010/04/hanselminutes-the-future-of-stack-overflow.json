Unlike you, I have little practical experience in it but I expect it will take more effort that just picking up some litter, done by a core of dedicated people. In SE1.0, the deal was that those dedicated people took the risk of building the community, chipped in some money to prove it, and had a shot at making (some) money from it in return. This is now gone, and the only people with a shot to make money from it are now you.

Matter and anti-matter.\n\nI don't care if you want to pay me $129 per month. Money isn't an effective way to build a community. I'd argue introducing money is actually more *dangerous* to a community than anything else.\n\nWhat is meaningful, and what I *do* care about, is that you can convince me that you LOVE the topic, and that together we can build a community of others who also love the topic. \n\nhttp://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/05/its-clay-shirkys-internet-we-just-live-in-it.html\n\n\"In the past, we could do little things for love, but big things, big things required money.

And sadly, nothing could be further from the truth once you outside the \"technical\" community.\n\nWhile Jeff makes a great point about the high proportion of visitors accessing the site from a search engine and thus \"entering\" on rather deeply positioned page, that does not address the use case of a site visitor needing to know \"what is this site I've found and how does it work\".\n\nThe point is we can anticipate a site visitor asking this no matter how they encountered the site.  The current design does not address this case as well as it could.\n\nFurther, will other communities actually be different that SO's traditional communities?\n\nI think so, absolutely.  As was discovered during the search for SF moderators, (and as Jeff has pointed out out many times on the podcast 1.0) communities exhibit subtle differences that can really matter, and small UI changes can make a seemingly disproportional difference - good and bad.\n\nFortunately, simple and basic UI/UX principles can help sort all this out. Test designs on real candidate users, perform A/B testing, etc.  Move the issue with a design out of \"opinion/debate\" arena and into the domain of actual user behavior.\n\nAnd by all means keep pursuing the goal of 2.0; it's worth it!"}, {"author_name": "Pekka", "gravatar_hash": "628d6cb4c2ad9d7b38a62f76a3bb7651", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 26, 2010", "message": "To elaborate on my Non-Profit comment above. I can totally understand somebody having invested years of time and probably also lots of money into a product, not wanting to turn that product into a nonprofit.

I think you have done outstanding work with Stack Overflow, I admire the integrity with which it is run, and you deserve to make lots of money out of it.

The only problem is that one of the more difficult tasks right now is setting up your Interested and Ignored tag lists. Hiding questions that do not interest you is probably the biggest thing you can do to make the homepage and question page more enjoyable, as it greatly reduces the signal to noise ration. Adding a \"Click the topics that interest you\" and \"Click the topics that you would like to ignore\" screen right after somebody creates an account would greatly help end users customize the site to their personal tastes."}]}
