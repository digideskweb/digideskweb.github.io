If two people asked the same question with completely different wording, that's a GOOD thing, because the next person to search for that same question may use similar wording to the first asker, or to the second. I just hope people don't take this as meaning \"identical questions should always have identical titles\"."}, {"author_name": "Jeff Atwood", "gravatar_hash": "51d623f33f8b83095db84ff35e15dbe8", "author_url": "http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/", "date": "Apr 26, 2010", "message": "Tyler, agreed, title edits should generally be additive when possible -- unless you're removing \"noise\" words that either don't help or actively harm the matching.\n\nI can think of a few title words that tend to match the wrong stuff, or stuff in different contexts, etc.\n\nAs I said in the post body.. \"small tweak\".
