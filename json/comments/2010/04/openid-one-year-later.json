OpenID certainly isn't perfect, but I agree with you that once there a greater migration to cloud-delivered services, the idea that a single browser instance will or should have all of your passwords will seem quaint.\n\nOf course your audience is more technical than the average audience, and are willing to jump through more hoops to secure their identity online.

Or if he banks online? I certainly understand that there will always be people who don't want to rely on others to protect or store their data, but increasingly I find that keeping data on my local harddrive just means that I have more worries about backing up my data, and that the data becomes less valuable over time because it's harder to share.\n\nThat might just be specific to me and how I use the web, but as it is, I own my identity because I host my own OpenID.
