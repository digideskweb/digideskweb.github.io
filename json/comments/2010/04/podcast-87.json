The site started out well on a great topic - anything and everything related to photography. The site is now rotting (literally) due to most of the reasons that SE 2.0 is going to cure:\n\n  * Not enough founding members\n  * Not enough marketing\n  * No real commitment\n\nWhich, of course leads to:\n\n  * Loss of interest from owners/moderators\n\nIts now (literally) gathering mold in the form of SPAM (possibly even deliberately) and its really sad. It could have been a fantastic resource in a sea of forums that offer (quite often) bad information.\n\nI'm really interested in seeing SE 2.0 launch, it really sounds like you fixed it."}, {"author_name": "Tim Post", "gravatar_hash": "84432a12912341ff38e157b3d2f4d145", "author_url": "http://echoreply.us/tech/", "date": "Apr 26, 2010", "message": "Oh, yeah, I for one welcome our new SysOp community overlord.
