Something about git on Windows *never* felt right and I couldn't put my finger on it. It is more like a 3rd or 4th class citizen but Windows was never its focus to begin with which I find pretty ironic but that's how Linus rolls.\n\nThe decision that finally pushed me to Mercurial was a future prospective employer using Kiln. So I grabbed the source and started compiling but I wanted SVN history during my initial imports. The headache of getting swig and python integration built when I had originally left it out made me further despise SVN. Somewhere along the 1.6 branch (not a jump from 1.5 like you'd hope), the main configure script broke the BerkeleyDB arguments so I had to research and poke until I figured out which child (apr) needed this and adjust by making my own higher level build script that built each peice accordingly I've only used twice now and I've hated both times.\n\nTortoiseSVN is perhaps the absolute best tool I've ever used. TortoiseMerge is phenominal. Now that I've started to get used to how Hg works, the absence of branches/ tags/ trunk/, etc I can safely say I won't be looking back into that sea of tragedy that luckily a front-end tool hid from me. Had I not been the one tasked with compiling the source I would have never known any real headache.\n\n\nJeff has outlined some of my pain points in switching as TortoiseHg and SVN are very different tools where things are not and will not be 1:1. It requires a lot of unthinking that TortoiseSVN just flat out did for me without any need to formally research. Hg on the other hand has needed a manual to guide me almost from second one which is not bad but it is the \"problem\" Jeff mentions on Twitter. If I have to think and research before every action, yes it does mean I am a n00b but I'm hoping at some point this will become routine knowledge. Because these tools are in an infantile stage, however, I feel obligated to keep my head \"in the books\" and study each change with a fine toothed comb.\n\nI suppose that's the price we pay for early adoption though."}, {"author_name": "Josiah Kiehl", "gravatar_hash": "44fa0745a224eabd917a753b7921b593", "author_url": "http://bluepojo.com", "date": "Apr 27, 2010", "message": "The biggest difference between git and hg is that git has GitHub.
