I've participated in 2 research studies at my University in the last 6 months and, in each case, I didn't get the actual disclosure document until I had indicated an initial interest.  If you don't get it before they start asking questions, though, I'd go even further and say that you should contact the human research board at the University.  All research involving human subjects has extensive requirements for privacy and risk management and needs to be approved by their HRB and follow their protocols.  It would be a serious violation to gather non-public data from individuals without some disclosure about how the data is collected and used and a signed agreement approving that use or a waiver from their HRB."}, {"author_name": "Paolo Bergantino", "gravatar_hash": "80ae8ec34e9e3e66c5be50733afaa44e", "author_url": null, "date": "May 31, 2010", "message": "Ohhh, pick me, pick me!"}, {"author_name": "Tom", "gravatar_hash": "6f708597287af6e0f7080a2dd8fdfd1a", "author_url": null, "date": "Jun 01, 2010", "message": "How are you guys going to decide which users get interviewed?
