Here's the thing, stackoverflow is always cited, not just because it was first but because it's  most obviously working. The central idea (top answer is probably right, no charge to see it) works for coding, but may not elsewhere.\n\nThe ideal topic is one in which\n\n\u2022 there are plenty of Internet-using users\n\u2022 those users have answers on some topics but questions about other topics (quid pro quo)\n\u2022 a 3rd party has an excellent chance (low type 1 and type 2 error) of judging whether the answer is correct\n\u2022 questions are mostly ad hoc, don't fit into a neat template.\n\nThe last two are both worth an example. If you've just started playing World of Warcraft and you use SO, you might think \"WarcraftOverflow\" is a great idea. Everybody who plays is on the Internet, and many are expert at some tiny corner of the game, at least briefly. But you're wrong, and here's why:\n\nFor most questions there's a neat template. A Wowhead search for \"Orange Dye\" gets you a single page which shows where you can get it, what it's for and so on. Same for places, people, anything with a name. If you have some unusual question related to the thing there's a comment thread per-topic.\n\nThe remaining questions (\"What's the best spec for a PvP druid?\") tend to be largely opinion and constantly changing. A popularly accepted \"best\" answer probably isn't right, and if it is right today it'll be wrong next month. These are better handled by conventional forums, which have short memories with the latest and greatest always at the top of the pile.\n\nSo for these topics (and I think the vast majority of topics will turn out to have one or both issues to some extent) an encyclopedia with comments plus a forum are a genuinely better approach than SO. In twelve months you may find that for every topic well-suited to SO's approach there are ten, or even a hundred that don't work. To meet your stated goals (not polluting the web with mediocre resources) those have to close, no doubt angering their users.\n\nNone of which makes stackoverflow itself less of a brilliant implementation of a good idea, but it may mean a limited life for stack exchange."}, {"author_name": "Clint", "gravatar_hash": "e72176a4d0a5454b329bc703c6fa8004", "author_url": null, "date": "May 05, 2010", "message": "Great.
