Users will love the reputation boost they get from asking their favorite question on the new, larger system. But we will not be able to migrate users or questions piecemeal. The code and databases are different and there\u2019s no association between users on the old system and the new network. In short, we don\u2019t want to start your shiny, new site off with initial problems and bad data.\n\nAm I understanding this correctly? Do you really expect us to have to ask/answer every question again on the new SE 2.0 site? That seems like a huge dis-incentive for users of the existing SE 1.0 site if they have to make a gold rush just to retain any of their reputation and ability. This may not be a big deal for users who use other SE sites, but for users who only use the single SE 1.0 site being migrated I think this would make them hesitant to continue to contribute."}, {"author_name": "TJB", "gravatar_hash": "20e04754409abe97cca30b5cda369fcc", "author_url": null, "date": "Jun 01, 2010", "message": "Hey what's that area51 under the network sites? going to area51.com returns a suspicious \"Hello World\" string...\n\nCAPTCHA: congest that"}, {"author_name": "BradC", "gravatar_hash": "c5c2165949f71bcd1fafbd8e694ab5f2", "author_url": "http://bradcorbin.net", "date": "Jun 01, 2010", "message": "So if I'm reading right, there are really 3 possible paths:\n\n1.
