In general inviting 100 random people into a public chat room is a bad idea and won't lead to anything useful.\n\nThe way this is *typically* done, is you'd have 3 or 4 moderators seeing a raw public chat and only pushing appropriate questions over to the \"real\" chat room.\n\nBut that solution is specific to \"public Q&A with a popular public figure\" format."}, {"author_name": "Jonathan Sampson", "gravatar_hash": "3eada417ab749e3a7a5d51d451b2cc3a", "author_url": "http://sampsonresume.com", "date": "May 05, 2010", "message": "Thanks for posting this, Jeff.

I've never looked too closely at the data-dump posts, but I don't think it has a link to any of this software.

Excellent work! That\u2019s not really much coming from an amateur publisher like me, but it\u2019s all I could think after enjoying your posts. Excellent grammar and vocabulary. Not like other blogs. You really know what you\u2019re talking about too. So much that you made me want to explore more. Your blog has become a stepping stone for me, my friend. Thank you for the articulate journey. I really enjoyed the 4 posts that I have read so far."}]}
