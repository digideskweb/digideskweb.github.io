This means easy LINQPad access now too for slicing up data like Ginsu(tm). Funny I could imagine \"slicing up data like Ginsu(tm)\" in some nerdcore somewhere.

Your data is more important to me than a Netflix is any day of the year but I'm biased.\n\nWow I just took the time to go play with it and I love it. Queries take on the existing question format from SE and the syntax is all right there for us to paste into our tools. Really. Fucking. Sweet.\n\nThis also made my idea of giving back to you guys 20x easier and I consider it a \"sign\" to get to work.
