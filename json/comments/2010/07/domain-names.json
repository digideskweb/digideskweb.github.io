Assuming the brand is a strong brand, I feel more comfortable within that series since I know there is a certain level of standards being enforced.  It also automatically gets reputation and authenticity points.  There's a lot of junk out there that is on standalone sites which you won't find at branded locations.  By \"junk\" I mean either low quality, untrue statements, ulterior motives, etc."}, {"author_name": "Brendan Miller", "gravatar_hash": "16cb3584428bed67b10a33f628d5b009", "author_url": "http://catphive.net/blog", "date": "Aug 03, 2010", "message": "I actually really dislike having so many different stack overflow sites. It's annoying to ask a question on stack overflow, only to have someone try to tell you it really belongs on some other site.\n\nI'm not going to spend the time to check 3 QA sites. Usually if I ask a question on server fault, I forget about it, because I never visit that site. From a users perspective additional sites add zero value. It would be better if you guys just figured out how to scale stackoverflow, and ditched server fault and the other sites."}, {"author_name": "Super Aardvark", "gravatar_hash": "1be1b7cb305fab96dda8fc3b2ad591d2", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 04, 2010", "message": "\"Right, and don\u2019t include Whale Fart as any part of your domain name.\"\n\nThere goes my idea for a stackexchange site for marine gastroenterologists."}, {"author_name": "Mark Kaiser", "gravatar_hash": "8db2ca745f13a0f7961280ecd17d6e4e", "author_url": "http://softwarecheese.blogspot.com", "date": "Aug 31, 2010", "message": "There's no reason that you can't do both - brand individually, and provide a sort of catalog subdomain at xxxxxx.stackoverflow.com that redirects and/or masks appropriately.   \n\nChoosing individually branded now is a good step, especially given the limited influence of the stack overflow brand.

I would have said, \"Americans looking for authoritative information, don't trust books whose titles insult them\".  If James Peterson had titled his book \"Hey Moron Did You Forget the Yeast Again?\", I wouldn't have cared how good or unique it was.\n\nThe Dummies series was remarkable in that it was perhaps the first time (and certainly the most successful) that a book got away with this, and didn't utterly fail in the marketplace.  In the same way that startups shouldn't look to emulate Microsoft (because there's only one Microsoft, or ever will be), new websites shouldn't look to learn naming rules from such a uniquely-named series.\n\nIf the \"dummies\" book wasn't part of a series, I'd still rather have the one that didn't say \"for dummies\".  And if there was a book from the O'Reilly series available, I'd rather have that than pretty much anything else you put next to it.\n\nNow, I don't know that \"stackexchange.com\" is the right 'series' here, but I think a good top-level brand could be fine.  Everybody I know (techies and non-techies alike) use *.google.com services, even the services of theirs that are crap.
