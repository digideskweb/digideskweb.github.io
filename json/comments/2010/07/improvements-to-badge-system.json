In order to get it you might have to limit your participation in more popular categories or answer more questions with users who accept answers but don't vote on them (and hope they accept but don't vote). Shouldn't you instead try and find a way to encourage at least the question asker to vote for the answer they are accepting? I wonder how much of this is driven by people wanting to keep their % of questions with accepted answers number up. \n\nMaybe I'm just bitter from being a day or so away from getting Tumbleweed and then having someone leave a comment.

Also, are accepted answers (with 0 score) you posted to your own questions counted for this? Probably shouldn't be, eh?"}]}
