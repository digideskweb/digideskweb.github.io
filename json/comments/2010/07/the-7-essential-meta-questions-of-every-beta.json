But there is something to be said for letting the community ask these questions of themselves. There is more a sense of ownership when the community takes it upon themselves to ask (and resolve) these questions... rather than just answering some \"form letter\" we post as part of a requirement by us.\n\nHence, the idea of the blog post to urge users to ask these questions of themselves.\n\n\n@Alex Andronov: I agree. With the proliferation of guest bloggers, we need a better way to identify who is speaking.\n\n\n@John Ferguson:\n> \u201cPrefer non-hyphenated names.\u201d :) \n\nHa!
