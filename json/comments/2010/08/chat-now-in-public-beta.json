I guess I will have to wait...\n\nAnyway, great job on the implementation. The problem of chat rooms is that the lifespan of a text is very short. Once it disappears from the screen, it is forgotten for ever.\n\nIt would be awesome to be able to upvote pieces of chat we like. It would allow to display the best pieces of conversation of a chatroom for example (and it will give points to the authors).\n\nCheers!"}, {"author_name": "Joe", "gravatar_hash": "35b5e9e9ccf3bfe5ff8d22b64a5234d3", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 05, 2010", "message": "@Aymeric That's sort of exactly how it works!
