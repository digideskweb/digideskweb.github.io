Make the 2 sites have separate URLs but make all questions asked by the ubuntu community show up both in Ubuntu.se and Unix.se?

It would open Pandora's box because other sites could request this but I do see the relevance in this case.  Ubuntu users want to see only Ubuntu questions but Unix users could answer both Unix and Ubuntu questions.\n\nThere could even be another way to do it.  Make Unix.se be the parent site.

Make it so if a user signs up at Ubuntu.se and Unix.se the account created is the same and can log in to both sites.

And I think you're right, the communities are biased. Then again, as long as both communities are functional (and no one knows what the best decision is), it's not the end of the world if they make the suboptimal choice.\n\nTo be honest, I'm more interested in how you're going to deal with this situation in the future, as new overlapping sites are proposed. The easiest way to deal with it is probably to adjust the proposal procedure or establish some guidelines allowing you to catch the overlap early on and, in the cases where you deem it a good idea, merge them.\n\nIf overlapping sites *keep* getting created, it'll eventually water down the entire SE network.\n\nIf you're up for another little challenge, how about the gamedev site vs StackOverflow?\nOf course, the gamedev one deals with non-programming subjects as well, which it should keep doing, but it seems an odd beast, born out of a common interest (we want to make games) rather than a common set of questions/answers/skills\n\nA game programmer can get better programming answers to his programming questions on StackOverflow, where most of the programmers are, than on gamedev.stackexchange.com, which is full of designers and writers and artists who can't code, and gamers who can't code but *want to*. I've already had a few discussions in comments on SO, with people who suggested (or demanded) that a question was asked on the gamedev site instead *because it was about game programming*. And likewise, a 3d artist would get far better answers to *his* questions on a hypothetical 3D art StackExchange site than on gamedev, which is full of all those artistically impaired programmers.\n\nI think that's a case where the overlap might be more harmful than the Unix/Ubuntu case, because it mixes so many people who aren't actually able to answer each others questions, and it hides those questions from the bigger sites where far more people would see them and be able to answer them.\n\nAnd I'm not sure what the solution is, especially now that the gamedev site has existed for so relatively long, and changing its scope would seem pretty invasive. Ideally, I would have restricted the gamedev site to those concerns that are really unique to game development (say, game design, and maybe working with modding tools and such), while directing game *programming* questions to SO, and *art* questions to, well, surely there ought to be one or more sites for that, where people who work with the same things (say, 3d animation) can get together and ask/answer questions, whether they work in movies or games or academia or somewhere else.\n\nFollowing on from this thought, would it make sense, at some point during a site's public beta to have an option of sending it back to the drawing board, and putting it in the express lane for a second try? Basically put it through another definition phase, followed by a shortened beta, primarily aimed at seeding the site, and verifying that the traffic is still there. I guess it's basically a more agile process, where the scope and definition of the site is adjusted repeatedly and iteratively, rather than the current waterfall model where *first* we find out what the site is about, *then* we fill it with content, and *then* we see if it was actually a good idea.\n\nIt is possible the same would make sense for the Ubuntu site. Perhaps, instead of merging it into Unix, it should simply have its scope adjusted to minimize the overlap. (although I don't know what this new scope should be)"}, {"author_name": "raven", "gravatar_hash": "1426f2e3692f98db654b81c87bc0dc91", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 20, 2010", "message": "This shouldn't be left up to the members of the two communities.
