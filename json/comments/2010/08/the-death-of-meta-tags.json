You consistently state that the sites are run by the community.  Well, those questions were tagged by the community and, with the exception of [subjective], I fail to see where the community got to weigh in on the removal of these tags before they happened.  I've noticed that expanding your mandate is a pretty consistent theme when it comes to making sweeping changes to the system.  I'll grant that you have sufficient reputation (in addition to being the owner/creator) to remove the tags, but if any one else had systematically removed all instances of a particular, highly-used tag, there probably would have been hell to pay, perhaps even a suspension.\n\nI particularly have a problem with the [best-practices] tag.  I think it's exactly the sort of meta-tag that actually does improve the classification of a question.  It helps distinguish a question seeking an answer to a specific problem from a question seeking the canonical way to approach a class of problems.  Your avatar derives from what is, essentially, an entire book about best practices: Code Complete.  Best practices is an essential part of our craft and the community often does coalesce around an agreed set of best practices in a particular class of problems.\n\nA question seeking knowledge on how to effectively reuse code is more accurately tagged [code-reuse] [best-practices], than simply tagged [code-reuse] -- using both makes it abundantly clear what the question is about.   Further a person who is interested in improving their skills, generally, could have searched the [best-practices] tag along with the tag for their area of interest, and found an abundance of material for their study.  A instructor looking for community-based input on best practices in software development, could have searched using only this tag and found a wealth of information.  Unclassified with this tag, you depend on content search and tag-based searches are much more effective than content searches.\n\nSo, while I'd really like to be congratulating you for removing two really, really bad tags, I find myself very disappointed that you've gone further than what I think the community would have done.\n\nI understand that the tag was overused.  It would have been a big job to go through and remove it except for cases where the user is particularly asking for help in determining best practices for a class of problems, but it's still a smaller problem than retroactively going back and applying it in the cases where it does actually improve the classification of the question.  Rather than removing this particular tag, I would have preferred that we encouraged its proper use and engaged the community in cleaning up the usage rather than apply the \"scorched earth\" approach."}, {"author_name": "Jakub Nar\u0119bski", "gravatar_hash": "672aa8b373071ef9f06db563d1c08d77", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 07, 2010", "message": "Perhaps a better solution would be to use different color (or shade) for meta-tags, and suggest that question needs additional tag if the only tag is meta-tag?"}, {"author_name": "jalf", "gravatar_hash": "5794f28dc1aba7a8844933816a6fa2c9", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 07, 2010", "message": "When first reading this, I was a bit iffy about the removal of some of the tasgs.

I thought to look here after seeing the request to help with [untagged] questions - and then it hit me, were it not for that e-mail, I probably would not even have noticed that those tags were gone.\n\nYou *know* a tag is useless when you've been reading and answering questions with those tags for a year, and they get zapped, and nothing seems amiss except maybe for an unconscious feeling of \"hmm, the site's looking a little cleaner today...\"\n\nAnyway, now that I'm here, I'd like to make a few points to the obvious detractors:\n\n1) Jeff did not \"cheat\".  Mass retags and merges have been an admin function for as long as I can remember, and they're normally uncontroversial and nobody notices them.  I'll bet that nobody would have noticed it this time either, if they hadn't announced it.\n\nAside from taking up a ridiculous amount of time, a \"manual\" retag would have made the front page useless, bombarding the site with hundreds of old questions that were probably not very good to begin with.  Anyway, I will be personally helping to organize the [untagged] questions and I'm fairly confident that others will take up the mantle as well.\n\n2) With respect to the \"community-run\" argument: There's a reason that no real society is a pure democracy.  The majority isn't always right.  Most people, when asked to make a tough decision, prefer to follow either some authority figure or, failing that, some vague perception of what everybody else is doing.  THAT is why the [subjective] and [best-practices] tags got so popular.  Left to its own devices, virtually any unmoderated online community will begin to suffer from scope creep and a torrent of newbie GTKY, religious wars and other open-ended questions.  That's why we have moderators, both community and official.\n\nWe should be thinking of the trilogy as more of a constitutional oligarchy.  Moderators and admins are there to serve the community, and sometimes, in so doing, they have to make decisions that are going to be unpopular with a certain group.  Sometimes they'll make mistakes, too, and we should never be afraid to question them or take them to task (lords knows I have!) - but we should question *specific* actions, and not the mere fact that they took some action without first getting \"approval\" from the community.  That's just silly; if they took that approach, half of the features we now take for granted probably wouldn't exist today.\n\n3) With all due respect, anybody who says that \"best practices is an essential part of craft\" needs to have some sense smacked into them.  \"Best practices\" do NOT help our craft, they cheapen it from a creative engineering discipline into a bureaucratic set of rules and regulations.\n\n\"Best practices\" tell us to turn off our brains, to ignore our environments and follow the advice of some guru.  What is a \"best\" practice anyway?  Best according to whom?  And by what criteria?  And in which circumstances?  Is it \"best\" because it's measurably better than all practical alternatives, or is possible that several alternatives were not even considered?\n\nI'm not going to belabor the point any further because James Bach has already explained it a million times better than I ever could:  http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/27\n\n4) For those advocating technical workarounds, like shading the meta-tags: Why?  What does this accomplish?  I can think of two things: (a) it makes the front page and tag pages look busier, and (b) it makes the tag system confusing as hell because every member has to keep track of which tags go in which category.\n\nI'd prefer not to have to answer a dozen support questions each week on \"why won't the site accept my question, it says there's something wrong with the tags!?\"  And the worst part of all of it is that instead of discouraging harmful or nuisance behaviours, it reinforces them!  It says that not only are these tags allowed, but that they are somehow \"special\".  We'll have people thinking that every question should have one of these tags, for balance.\n\nThink I'm making this up?  There's actually a very vocal member on one of the SE betas who insists that subject tags are \"vertical\" tags whereas meta-tags are \"horizontal\" tags, and that it's actually a good thing for questions to have both.  Making meta-tags special - even if it's a bad kind of special - is essentially cementing precisely this ideal.  Bad, bad, bad.  No, we do not need special highlighting or special rules.\n\n---\n\nParting thoughts:\n\nGive it a couple of days.  Let yourself get used the absence of these tags, and after a few days, ask yourself if you really miss them.  That's how I decide how to get rid of house clutter; if I haven't used it in more than a year, it's probably useless to me.  So do this with the meta-tags.  Monitor your asking/answering habits and watch for any instances of you saying to yourself, \"man, this would be a LOT easier if we still had the [subjective] tag.\"\n\nIf you catch even one, I'll eat my hat.\n\nCongratulations and thank you to the team for seeing the light on this one!"}, {"author_name": "Konrad", "gravatar_hash": "f9401202ab73e624cc82800b0fff1489", "author_url": "http://madrat.net", "date": "Aug 07, 2010", "message": "\u201cWhat you should be asking yourself is this: for each tag you use, could a question with *only* that tag be valid?\u201c\n\nJeff, you\u2019re basically just paraphrasing the definition of meta tag.

Consider the tag C#; it's certainly a 'dependant' tag in that a question about WCF tagged only C# doesn't really say anything about the question as others have pointed out already.\n\nSecondly:\n\"If the tag commonly means different things to different people, it\u2019s probably a meta-tag.\"\n\nWe have the same problem here: The statement has truth, but it also includes a number of cases that are decidedly not the case. I know from personal experience that the following tags on SO would mean different things to different people: design-patterns, oop, orm, asynchronous-programming, etc. \n\nThe problem isn't so much a problem with the tags, it's more likely misinformation and a lack of knowledge/experience on the part of the those who would disagree.\n\nThirdly: \n\"If the tag can\u2019t work as the only tag on a question...\"\n\nThe problem is that it's not (or shouldn't be) reasonable to expect a tag to stand on its own.

However it doesn't solve the underlying issue - that people still want a way to occasionally filter the list of questions in a way that is more about relevance to them, than simply topic-based filters (a la the \"favorite\" and \"ignored\" tags).\n\nThough it's proven to be a very unpopular proposal (http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/116843/a-proposed-solution-to-homework-easy-questions-and-other-issues-around-filt), I think a filter (or maybe just a view, as is suggested in the comments) that allows you to filter questions based on relative reputation gained in tags (relative to your own reputation gain in a tag) can help answer some of the qualitative features that people want, in addition to outlawing meta-tags.\n\nThe point is, the use of meta tags is a symptom of what people ultimately want, and they were using tags as the best solution available."}, {"author_name": "Jeff Lunt", "gravatar_hash": "8ef93fcf1d542ad7bbe654a74d24716d", "author_url": "http://jefflunt.com", "date": "Dec 22, 2011", "message": "i.e. build a better filter, and people won't try to use tagging for filtering."}]}
