Ubuntu just happened to have marketed themselves better and while other distributions depended on CD sales as a service to fund the work, Ubuntu invested in marketing their products by seeding the world with their brand of Linux and gave CDs away for free. \n\nThis worked wonders, but Ubuntu is not more \"user friendly\" than other user-friendly Linux distributions.

The internet isn\u2019t shrinking, it\u2019s getting bigger every day.\"\n\nReally? Then what is the justification for StackOverflow? Wouldn't it be better to allow all the thousands and thousands of programming sites that were already there to go on? SO explicitly tries to collect *everything* programming-related on one site, in one community.\n\nIt also doesn't make much sense. A community with 5000 active members is much better and more helpful than 10 communities with 1000 members each. The total size of the pie doesn't matter. What matters is how big the individual slice is. The goal of SO wasn't to make a bigger pie, it was to make a pie with fewer slices. \n\nSo we didn't have to do a Gogle search and then trawl the first 50 results, each pointing to different sites that might or might not have a relevant answer to our question, but instead only had to go to *one* site and find answers to *everything*.\n\nI think the Area51 process needs some kind of \"benevolent dictator\" oversight *in addition* to the community-driven approach. If you just let the community do its thing, you get something like Linux, where everyone and his uncle maintains his own distro, and each of these are competing, rather than cooperating. You can argue that this is a good thing for Linux (I'm not so sure), but for a Q&amp;A site, I fail to see how it can be positive.\n\nA single *popular* site, where your question will be read by a lot of people who are able to answer it, trumps my little pocket community of 20 people no matter how much expertise those 20 members have.\n\nOf course, I'm not saying the community-driven approach is a bad thing, or that your \"evil Jeff\" approach would be better. That's going to the other extreme, and it would be far, far worse than what you have currently. \n\nBut remember that StackOverflow wasn't created because the community of programmers across the world decided \\let's pool our knowledge on this one uber-site\\. It was created because two specific programmers had a vision for pulling this off, and *making* the community come and make the site a success.\n\nWithout those two visionaries, SO would never have existed. You can't let the community do its thing entirely freely, or you end up with a million communities, each too small to serve their purpose of actually running a popular Q&amp;A site. Exactly like we had before SO.\n\nSo my suggestion:\nKeep the area51 process as is, but follow up with some kind of by-hand filtering/merging/approval process where you/Joel/select StackExchange employees make a subjective judgment of whether the site should be made permanent or scrapped (the existing options), or merged into another. And in making this decision, doing what you did in the Ubuntu case might be a good idea: email prominent members of the two sites, and ask how they'd feel about a merger, discuss what could be done to make it work, and then either create the site and accept the overlap, or merge it into another.\n\nQuite simply, am I going to get better answers to my questions as an Ubuntu user by having a dedicated Ubuntu site? On one hand, many knowledgeable Ubuntu users will be there. On the other hand, all those Linux users who don't focus specifically on Ubuntu, who might *also* be able to answer, almost certainly won't see my question.\n\nThe problem is that the Ubuntu community by themselves almost certainly won't give you a reliable answer. They'll just fight for their independence... The way Java programmers and C++ programmers and Perl programmers did until they got rolled up into StackOverflow.\n\nAnd maybe the Ubuntu users are right this time, maybe they are better off alone. Maybe not. So perhaps we need the \"benevolent dictator\" to make the final call.\n\nIf you leave it to the community, *every* site will decide it's better off alone. And eventually you'll get a C++ site and a Java site on SE competing with SO."}, {"author_name": "Miguel de Icaza", "gravatar_hash": "2f7d76c50d0b76b8ce21808ab68e93d1", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 15, 2010", "message": "I address the specific difference between MacOS vs other Unix in this post:\n\nhttp://meta.unix.stackexchange.com/questions/15/macosx-whats-on-topic"}, {"author_name": "Scott", "gravatar_hash": "629cfe92c00bcb6a8cb13834a3b23e17", "author_url": "http://reusablecode.blogspot.com", "date": "Aug 15, 2010", "message": "I'd compare this to a site for people who enjoy using electricity vs. a site for people in the electricity generation industry.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading it beyond my interest in the subject.\n\nUnlike most here on this forum I support the idea of breaking out as many specialty sites as there are people who are clamoring for them. Whenever people are interested in specialization it's because they have reasons that motivate them to want it.  One specific reason is that it's easier to have a high reputation relatively speaking on a more specific site than on a broader site (there are ways to address this somewhat that I plan to discuss on meta, but those ways don't exist today.  See http://meta.wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/64/top-users-by-tag-suggestion-for-stackexchange for a preview.)\n\nWhat surprised me though is the level of visceral opposition to the creation of specialized communities. It almost feels like pro-lifers circling an abortion clinic where you've got people who adamantly want to impose on others the circumstances under which they may operate and the choices they might have. It just doesn't feel right to me.\n\nBut I guess it shouldn't surprise me; this is not new; people have jockeyed for position like this for time immemorial. Look at Canada and the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Or Sri Lanka and the Tami Tigers. Or Iraq and the Kurds. And these are only references from modern day. If you want to go back further there was the war between the Continental Army and the British Crown (for those who don't catch the reference, it's the war that created the USA.) And as long as men (and women) exist they will seek to carve out their own territory; after all there are far more who prefer to be a big fish in a small pond than vice-versa.\n\nWhat's more, it's in StackExchange's best interest to grow as many different *successful* sites as they can much like it's in Proctor &amp; Gambles best interest to offer you seven different types of laundry detergent; the more they offer the more likely they are to have a brand that resonates with each and every prospect and keeping them from ceding the ground to others.\n\nSo for those people here who are fighting against these \"splinterings\" it is a fool errand. Since there is no taxing government to oppose the separatists on StackExchange fighting this is simply a lost cause. Your wanting it not to change won't make it not.\n\nI myself made the initial proposal for WordPress Answers even though SO had  over 3000 questions tagged \"wordpress.\" And as it is exiting private beta tomorrow I am already seeing even more value in it being exclusively WordPress than I originally envisioned. The quality of answers on WA are much higher on average than the \"wordpress\" tagged answers on SO, \n\nI also feel a community forming around WA that I've just never felt over at SO (probably because SO was so broad I never felt the urge to contribute.) Sure there is community among the top contributors on SO but Dunbar's Number tells you that after a community grows past 150 members it becomes too big for everyone to know and respect everyone else and that's when factions start forming.  \n\nActually Dunbar's Number would suggest that StackExchange *should* create more specialized sites. A rule of thumb could be that anytime the top (10% of?) contributors exceeds 150 then it's time to split to community in half. There's even a very successful (and mostly unknown) company whose name I can't remember who has an internal rule that it must split a division in two when said division exceeds 150 employees. And that's one of the ways they've been successful.\n\nWorse, on SO you get people who have no knowledge of WordPress at all answers questions about WordPress it because WordPress questions often imply PHP, MySQL, jQuery, CSS or other answers and because answering questions is what those people do. And with a lack of speciality on SO there are not enough others who are policing the site to provide a check and balance on these bad answers. This leads people in the wrong direction which is wrong, wrong, wrong! For example, WordPress uses MySQL but best practice is to use the PHP-based API whenever possible. I see people on SO recommending complex MySQL queries when a simple API call will do!\n\nThat said, let me suggest that everyone instead put their heads together and work on a solution?  As I see it the problem is cross-over content and cross-over between communities. Agree, or no?\n\nBTW, I do agree with the hardliners on one thing; it's saddens me to see a great answer for my favorite topics over on another site. So at a very high level I think there's a need for StackExchange to develop a way for sites to share tags and content and people. \n\nFor example: \n\n1.) When someone posts a WordPress question on SO they could choose to apply it to the WordPress Answers site in addition or instead. \n\n2.) We could also have the communities at SO and at WA collaborate on tags that would automatically be shared, i.e. \"wordpress\" is a no brainer but there are many more. \n\n3.) People with enough reputation could \"attach\" or \"detach\" the linkage of questions between site. \n\n4.) And possibly there could be reputation shared across sites via some formula and that each user could to influence via his or her profile.\n\nBut it will be a hard problem to solve so many there needs to be a meta discussion about how to solve?  \n\nAnyway, that's far more than JMTCW.

Now it seems that for the sake of brands and products what we have in an \"Ubuntu community\" a \"Fedora Community\" an \"OpenSUSE community\".   Everyone has a \"community\" aimed at advancing a particular brand of Linux distribution.\n\nLinux distributions come and go.   SLS was the first \"user friendly\" one because the HJ Lu disks were not \"friendly\".    Then \"Slackware\" was the good one, because unlike SLS it had a nice UI for installation (text mode, back in the day).   Then we had Red Hat, and that was better, because it had a full installer and had upgradeable packages!     In France we had Mandrake, in Germany SUSE, in Brazil Connectiva, all of those were desktop-centric, user-focused Linux distributions.  And next we have Ubuntu.   It is unique in that it has a unique source of funding, it does not depend on users paying for some service to keep the development going and you can debate the merits of that, just like some have debated how Ubuntu works with the rest of the larger open source community and the whole \"upstream\" contribution debate.\n\nToday there are a number of user-focused Linux distributions.   None matches the marketing and funding that went behind Ubuntu, so it is understandable that some folks in the Ubuntu community do not know where their software came from, who created that software, and who funded that software development.\n\nThat software was created for the most part by that \"open source community\" that right now you have decided is too different from Ubuntu, because that faceless community has been focused on creating the software that you use.   That is where those of us that create the software that you run are concerned about: fixing bugs, making the code more stable, adding features, triaging bugs, translating and testing the software.\n\nI wish that you thought about the larger \"community\" as opposed to merely a particular brand of Linux that exists today.   And you cared about improving and supporting the ecosystem that has created the grounds for Ubuntu to even exist in the first place.\n\nI realize this is asking too much.   At some point there is a sense of allegiance to \"my team\", whatever \"my team\" is.   It is irrational, just like in sports, just like in nationalism, just like in schools, just like in any other group.   \n\nYour argument boils down to \"my team\", I wish that people in the community cared about advancing the broader goals of free software and open source software as the principles is what matters to those of us that built the system.   I realize that those that are new to the community might not have the whole story, and it is why it is easy to focus on \"my team\" vs the greater goals.\n\nI have been writing free software, mostly to advance the user experience on Linux for the last 18 years, so \"my team\" is a little bit larger than the distribution of the day."}, {"author_name": "Umang", "gravatar_hash": "e0c49abbf2db17e7a944af4b19d03ce2", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 20, 2010", "message": "I was one of those people who committed myself to Ubuntu and fulfilled my commitment in the private beta, I registered on Unix &amp; Linux only in the public beta (in fact, so recently my reputation is still 101).

That is just reality. I myswlf have lived in a lot of different countries and in every place, I have made this same experience. \n\nIf you do not like it and you force people together bad things happen. See, what happen with Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, etc.\n\nEach of theses communities has different goals coming from their differences. They will follow those goals. However, this does not mean that this different goals are contra-productive. Even a mount of ants has groups of ants with different goals. Some will go and get food, some will defend the mount. Overall, both is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the question is: Do we embrace the diversity that is inevitably there, or do we try to put everybody into one uniform?\n\nDo you want to have a clone army, or do you want to have individuals that can aspire their own individualism as they chose.\n\nWhat you call branding, is the result of individual choices. Because of it, we have choices (as to before when everybody had to use the one and only OS that was available). \n\nWe have the choice now, if we want to allow this choices to be made, or if we force everybody to wear the same shoe. \n\nWhy don't we just have all questions ask on stackoverflow? You can tag it. It doesn't matter that one is asking about cooking techniques, the next one about the English language, the third one about Home Improvement. \n\nSo why do you split up sites anyway? But you know, in effect we don't. Yes, there is a form of segmentation, but still all is together on this amazing ether called Internet.\n\nDiversity is better than a monolithic society. Diversity allows ideas to be tested and to compete in a friendly competition. Diversity allows things to be checked out and see what will survive, instead of making the decision for everybody else.\n\nThe fact that Open Source has so many brands is our strength, not our weakness. \n\nOnly because you do something under a brand, does not mean that you do not support the whole! When I watch my favorite sport, I cheer for my favorite team, but you know what I also cheer for the sport. \n\nWhen we organize community events under the Ubuntu banner, we also promote Linux. We also promote every single project that promotes to Open Source. We also promote every single contributor.\n\nAs more people like SuSe, RedHat, Debian, Ubuntu and any distro, as more people like Linux. All of these brands add to each other, we do not subtract from another.\n\nThe reason is the diversity. If everybody would be the same, we would not need so many brands. We could just have the \\Einheitsstaat\\ the unified country, as the former East Germany called itself to forcefully.\n\nHowever, we all know how it ended. Working together does not require uniformity. In fact the diversity makes working on the common goals we have stronger.\n\nThere is enough space for all of us. And we can support each other. We do this already. That is the idea of Open Source. However, Open Source is not only software. Open Source is a philosophy that goes far beyond software. This is one of the movements we capture in our community. \n\nYou are on \\my team\\ does not matter what. However, that does not mean we cannot give each other the space we need to do things the way we know best.\n\nHaving the two sites as they are now allows us to do exactly that. \n\nDo you really believe if the two sites would be merged it would be the end of it? No, it would not. The same day another ask.ubuntu.com site would come up on another server. As I said in my blog.

Those with a greater interest in Ubuntu, will probably looking mainly at questions with the [ubuntu] tag.\n\nAnyway, I get the feeling that at least some of those against the merge will eventually (maybe much later) be for a merge, so I'm hoping that SE has an way of efficient merging."}, {"author_name": "Umang", "gravatar_hash": "e0c49abbf2db17e7a944af4b19d03ce2", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 22, 2010", "message": "^ That should have been \"has an efficient way of merging\"."}, {"author_name": "Denilson", "gravatar_hash": "5048ffde7ab92aeeedf45959f6d13c24", "author_url": "http://my.opera.com/CrazyTerabyte/", "date": "Aug 22, 2010", "message": "My little opinion: I think that there are some questions (and answers) that could (or should) be shown in more than one site.

If you can find out some way to \"share\" questions between multiple stackexchange sites, it might be a good solution.\n\nAlso, StackOverflow is great because sometimes I have a problem that I need to solve using one language; then I find a nice solution, but for another language, at StackOverflow, and this guides me to the solution of my original problem.

I think this is the wrong approach. Nothing here is supposed to be some competition for love or affection. Jealousy and spite don't belong here.\n\nThe way I see it, there have been set clear requirements what kind of commitment/support etc. a certain proposal has to fulfill to go into beta and later into a permanent site. As far as I see this it in the end that the advertisement money obtained by a site pays for the cost (i.e there will be profit) as requirement for stackexchange. In order to get to this you need to have functioning community.\n\nIf you have a particular question that is more broader Linux related, you probably have to things in mind if you decide where to ask the question. \n\n1) Is the expertise to answer this question on the particular site.\n2) Do you feel comfortable to ask the particular question in the particular community.\n\nIf you make positive experiences in how you are approached and interacted with, you are likely to come back. If you feel disrespected, misunderstood or get other negative responses, you probably don't come back. And this is in particular true for a lot of the people that we a aiming to reach on the Ubuntu site. People who are not really interested in Linux as a technology, but people that have taken the courage to move to something unknown for them and are stuck and need help.\n\nThose people do not care about duplication and all the technical mumbo jumbo that is discussed here. Reading through some of the comments here of the proponents of merging, I am not sure if their interest is necessarily this set of community.\n\nI myself, being active on both sites, have asked questions on both sites. I have made the decision where to ask according to where I expected a good result. And so far this has worked very well.\n\nTo your last question about every possible distro starting such a site: Well, isn't that already happening anyway? Doesn't every community have their own fora, their own IRC channels, their own bug tracker.\n\nWouldn't it be far better if we had only one Linux distro, one desktop, one Office suite...\n\nI think we could discuss this for a long time without finding an answer that would be accepted by everyone. And to an extend only future will tell. So far we have two models in the IT world. A proprietary model that tells the user what he gets, and an open model which allows the user to choose what he wants to get. I think, it is amazing how well the Linux community to the biggest extent is able to provide choices that have high quality and even inspire each other and hence create if better solution. Since we can do this with software, I believe we can do this also with support concepts.\n\nLet's have these things play out. If we don't allow some experiments to happen (and area51 is such an experiment), we cannot learn, what works and what does not work. If we always stop trying something new, we never innovate. I believe if we allow things to develop, we will find better solutions than if we just decide by trying to predict the future. \n\nI don't think we have all the answers today. We will find some of them when we try things and reflect."}, {"author_name": "Chris Pall", "gravatar_hash": "7f07010669c0baa7b4ca5198d96fd751", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 23, 2010", "message": "Phils suggestion makes the most sense of all.

Therefore, I am not totally convinced by your argument. Secondly, the advantage of not having just one Linux disto is diversity in execution, style, policy, etc. I don't believe that each distro having it's own SE will add diversity to SE.\n\nI'm willing to accept whatever decision the vote will result in, although I would certainly prefer a merge."}, {"author_name": "Ryan", "gravatar_hash": "6f95c8971349908ff04366889830583d", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 24, 2010", "message": "I think that the best test of whether to merge the two sites may be the empirical one.
