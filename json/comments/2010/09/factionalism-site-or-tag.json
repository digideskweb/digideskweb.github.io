That's like saying \"How do I build a web app?\" is the most common kind of question on Stack Overflow.  People are going to have *specific*, in-depth questions about *specific* testing situations and that's the point - those questions do exceptionally poorly on Stack Overflow because they get buried before anyone who's actually qualified to answer them can see them.\n\nI know, it's just another one of my belligerent, zany, opinionated ideas, but I think the root cause here is that the definition phase of Area 51 is intrinsically broken for the same reason that the reputation system is sorta broken on Stack Overflow: It rewards cheap, generic, easy-to-understand sound bites, and those are precisely the ones that *should* be voted as \"Not A Good Example.\"  That's what nearly killed (and may still kill) the Software Engineering proposal.\n\nSure, you can ask really easy, generic testing questions \"How can I unit test multi-threaded code?\" on Stack Overflow and get a few good answers.  But narrow that down to \"How can I unit test the 50 different kinds of item expirations in my thread-safe asynchronous cache implementation that relies on a component with its own hidden timer thread to expire items - without having to re-implement that component myself or waiting all afternoon for the tests to complete?\" and see what kind of \"quality\" answers you get on Stack Overflow.  You'll probably get one answer linking to CHESS and if you're lucky, another answer with extremely generic advice on mocking that probably doesn't apply to your situation.\n\nIf you want to blame the failure of the system (Area 51) on an intrinsic problem with the community (\"factionalism\") then I guess I can't stop you.  But you're wrong.  Very, very wrong.  This isn't factionalism, this is the very *opposite* of factionalism, it's the Dunning-Kruger effect, the result of people with only a shallow, superficial understanding of a subject arrogantly assuming that there IS no more depth.  From the perspective of someone professionally engaged in testing or engineering or compiler design, it's analogous to teenage computer nerds claiming that they're \"hackers\" who are more than qualified to discuss the finer points of advanced cryptosystems.\n\nI still think that you will, eventually, need to start dividing up the communities on Stack Overflow, even if they all still technically exist on the same site (i.e. by virtue of mega-tags like another commenter suggested).  This is NOT because the communities hate each other or are elitist - that's just silly - but because too many questions are already going unanswered due to the mass saturation of overall questions (most of which are irrelevant to whoever is browsing the site at any given time).\n\nPutting everything together on one site was the RIGHT decision at the beginning, absolutely, no question - but you're refusing to recognize *scale* problems.  People are starting to say \"Hey, these questions don't tend to do very well on Stack Overflow and I'd like to have a community that can handle them properly\", and they're *committing* to these prospective communities, and you already *have* all the tools to support them - but instead of embracing that, you declare them \"factions\" and want to throw the proposals out the window.\n\nYou're becoming victims of your own success.

If you're not interested in any of the new releases (or they've already been rented out), you can try browsing by category, except that every category is a huge dumpster bin with all of the movies just piled in there with no organization or vetting whatsoever.  And there are 200,000 other people crowded in the same store trying to dig through the bins at the same time.  If you want to find Canadian Bacon, first you have to muscle your way past two dozen hipsters and sift through 300 snuff movies and home videos.\n\nAnd that's what \"factionalism\" is all about.  Building an actual sub-community around, say, the Sci-Fi genre and getting together for screenings and conventions, having your own TV channel, and generally not caring about the latest Rom-Com flavour of the month.\n\nThis is exactly what you ALREADY DID with Stack Overflow!  Part of what you did was look at the discussion forums and come up with a better UI.  But more importantly, you guys looked at existing Q&amp;A sites with similar UIs like Yahoo Answers and said, umm, how is this crap supposed to work for specialized communities like programmers?  Let me see and ask questions specific to programming and not have to read about some idiot's latest breakup!\n\nExcept you all seem to think it stops there, whereas in reality, these sub-communities grow organically and you end up with sub-sub communities like, say, the Trekkies, and they decide that after fifty collective seasons and god knows how many movies and easily tens of thousands of followers, they want their OWN screenings and conventions and whatnot because they're not interested in Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica and all that other crap.  And the cycle begins anew.\n\nYou're all acting like this is a thoughtful decision that's been researched on every level.  Except it's not.  It's you and a few other people saying \"Oh, we want segregation, but not THAT MUCH segregation.\"  You could have easily gone and made Stack Overflow a general IT site for all professional IT questions but you didn't; you decided that Server Administration was a separate topic that needed to be discussed on a separate site.\n\nYou've gone ahead and created this so-called \"democratic\" process called Area 51 and even though I've come to the conclusion over the past few months that it's fundamentally broken, it's still wrong for you to be acting like tinhorn dictators about it and say \"actually, it's only a democracy if we like what you vote for, and if we think you've screwed up, we're going to level the entire city and rebuild it ourselves.\"  Either let the communities grow out the way they want to or just kill Area 51 completely and do your own market research and create new Stack Exchange sites as you, personally, see fit.\n\nIf you want a dictatorship, I'm *fine* with that, but call a spade a spade already.  Admit that your decisions are arbitrary or at least intuitive instead of smugly insisting that the failure of *your* system to produce coherent site definitions is actually a conceptual failure of the proposal itself and thus overwhelming evidence that you and only you know exactly what level of isolation is best for everyone.\n\nIt's fine if you want to kill joke proposals, to clamp down on people abusing Area 51 for rep and general entertainment.  But now you're getting ready to kill perfectly legitimate proposals on the grounds that they'll drain membership from Stack Overflow.  That's like pointing to the Mexican immigrants and screaming \"THEY TOOK URRR JOBS!\"  Or the RIAA/MPAA pointing to torrent sites and screaming \"THEY TOOK URRR SALES!\"  It's just not true.\n\n*** People are trying to create these little clique communities because they've already decided that Stack Overflow ISN'T the place for them, as George Edison stated in no uncertain terms on MSO.  You've *already* lost that audience from Stack Overflow, at least insofar as any questions they may have about compiler design or software architecture are concerned. ***\n\nBaloney, you say?  Take a look at these two queries:\n\nhttp://odata.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/s/546/top-users-without-new-posts\n\nhttp://odata.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/s/547/top-users-with-infrequent-posts\n\nAs of August 31st, out of the top 500 users, 247 averaged less than 1 post per day, 77 averaged less than 1 per week, and 139 had not posted anything within 1 week.  Maybe they're all on vacation or something but the writing on the wall seems pretty clear to me: People at the top are disillusioned, they're not finding good questions to answer on Stack Overflow anymore, and based on the kinds of proposals you're seeing on Area 51, it would seem that many of them would prefer to participate in smaller communities where good content doesn't get buried under a heap of trash within 5 minutes.  It might take a while to get a good answer but at least they'll *get* a good answer.\n\nGuys, I'm in your corner.  I want you to succeed.  I've invested a huge amount of my personal time on Stack Overflow and Area 51 and a few of the betas.  I'm not trying to put you down, I just want you to start taking a more objective look at all of the wonderful things you've accomplished so far.  People are strange and unpredictable, *crowds* doubly so, and communities with 300,000 people just don't function as well as communities with 3000 people; they may have more total activity but large swathes of individuals will have less activity and be less satisfied on average.  You can either keep up with the trends, or you can deal with the attrition.  Simple as that.\n\nTags aren't going to solve it.  They just aren't.  When I say I don't want to walk into a store with 300,000 people standing shoulder-to-shoulder, I MEAN that I don't want to walk into that store.  Telling me exactly where to go to find exactly one type of product does NOT address my concerns, especially when I'm looking for 20 different items and a sizable percentage of them are mislabeled anyway.  Rest assured we'll all shop at Wal-Mart when we want something cheap and convenient - but there's still plenty of room for the good old-fashioned strip mall that has separate stores for home theatre equipment and DJ/mixing equipment, even though they're sort of related.\n\nAnd if you refuse to run those stores, somebody else will eventually be glad to step in."}, {"author_name": "Jeff Atwood", "gravatar_hash": "51d623f33f8b83095db84ff35e15dbe8", "author_url": "http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/", "date": "Sep 29, 2010", "message": "> People are trying to create these little clique communities because they\u2019ve already decided that Stack Overflow ISN\u2019T the place for them, as George Edison stated in no uncertain terms on MSO. You\u2019ve *already* lost that audience from Stack Overflow, at least insofar as any questions they may have about compiler design or software architecture are concerned.\n\nFine, so if they're so lost, why are they even at Area 51 in the first place? Why aren't they long gone already from this terrible wasteland of a place? Something doesn't quite add up there.\n\n> Tags aren\u2019t going to solve it.

The community gets <i>input</i> into the process at all times, yes -- but the community doesn't always do a great job of seeing the bigger picture."}]}
