Those who will take an interest in a site that ignores language boundaries are valuable to programming. It's a perfect selection.\nOn the other hand, those who would rather have a $language$ site, while they would likely participate in it, are likely to be less valuable (likely less experienced overall).\n\nNow this leads perfectly to the unix/ubuntu split. Who wants the join? Mainly the unix people, whose interests extend beyond the particular Distro/OS. These people, as with lang. agnostic programmers, could be considered more valuable to the community.\n\nNow comes the argument that although experienced people understand Ubuntu, there are people who use Ubuntu with interests cut off from the more agnostic types. These people aren't going to grow into agnostic types anymore than an average person grows into an electrician.\nThis is a fact, and this is 95% more likely to happen with a Ubuntu user than with any other distro.\n\nThe facts are all in place, now the million dollar question:\nTo merge or not to merge?\n\nBreak it down a bit now:\n\nWill the separate Ubuntu community (presumably people who \"don't want to be electritians\") be able to provide good answers for each other, and so make a good community?\n\nWill the combined Unix community churn out bash scripts and compilation instructions to this \"non-electrician\" community to where you lose it?\n\n\nI believe the first question's answer, while unable to be certain, is likely \"no\", at least compared to what it would be otherwise. It will depend on people who are \"electritians\" to have good answers. While I'm sure there are some very knowledgable people who just want to help average users, on the whole it will likely be a second rate community.\n\nNow if the second question has a yes answer, even if the first has no, it could be said that you may as well separate, because it's a mediocre community vs losing the people altogether. That makes this question the real key.\n\nTo this second question, I must humbly submit that I believe the answer is also no. I believe that the best answer is the simplest one that works, and while in the forums of times past those were hit and miss, with the system provided in stackoverflow this should change.\n\nNon-electritians and those who want to help them progress will find that it's not the people that gave bad/complicated answers, but the horrid forum systems of the past. They will find a combined site to be nothing like what's been on the internet before.\n\nPlease Jeff, be a dick, do the right thing."}, {"author_name": "Paul Howells", "gravatar_hash": "6d6f1dcbeaf6819cfb5dc8b624901a3e", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 04, 2010", "message": "So what would happen if \nUbuntu.stackexchange questions were visible to Unix.stackexchange users (signalled or tagged as #ubuntu to maintain context), \nand \nUnix.stackexchange questions remained invisible to Ubuntu.stackexchange users \n?\n\nI have no idea, but I'd like to know if it could work."}, {"author_name": "Roberto Lopez Bujan", "gravatar_hash": "0489be5102e78562fe8c9ea280e91c2d", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 04, 2010", "message": "Not all users are invested in the tribe, but all users are invested in the answer.\n\nThis is why I still post questions to Google's search box, because Google infiltrates all sides and will find my answer among Stack Overflow, Superuser, and Server Fault.  \n\nMaybe the solution is to find a way to make the stack exchange search boxes include answers from related stack exchanges with priority or preference provided to the results closest to the user's cult interests (Ubuntu people or Universalists).  \n\nThen everybody wins, but everyone also gets a front-end that speaks to their tribe."}, {"author_name": "Peter", "gravatar_hash": "9a9c700d14f561980defa3f295ba2c93", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 04, 2010", "message": "Who'll be the first to post the same question to both groups with: \"Apologies for the cross-posting, but ...\""}, {"author_name": "\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a", "gravatar_hash": "e4b4b53c8d104121d634f5f705be5270", "author_url": "http://www.soqak.com", "date": "Sep 05, 2010", "message": "long live Ubuntu"}, {"author_name": "Caleb Cushing ( xenoterracide )", "gravatar_hash": "e990c7cdac81e570939c4d5b17303b42", "author_url": "http://www.xenoterracide.com", "date": "Sep 05, 2010", "message": "@Paul unfortunately I type phonetically, and my web browser does not catch when I type the wrong word.

Someone to stop and think and say \"Ok, we've got a Linux site here, and a Ubuntu site gathering speed. There is a conflict of interests we need to resolve\". Then either merge them outright, or transform them into separate Linux-Users and Linux-Hackers sites, since that essentially seems to be the distinction the Ubuntu users cared about, or along some other axis that would cover the same ground, but without the overlap.\n\nThe solution didn't have to be \"One *nix site to rule them all\".

It is a waterfall model, where the sites are only evaluated at the very end, after they've been in use for months. And that makes it nearly impossible to change or reject a site once it gets that far. For the A51 concept to work, a more agile approach is needed, where the sites are constantly evaluated and tweaked, not just by their own community, but by someone aware of what's happening in the *rest* of the StackExchange universe as well. Someone who can push the scope of a site in the direction with the least overlap, and who can take the hard decisions when necessary.\n\nSo-called democracy is just going to give us what we had a couple of years ago: a million useless forums, and no idea where to look for answers to our questions.\n\nI'd have thought that the founders of StackOverflow, of all people, knew better than to blindly let the community fracture itself."}, {"author_name": "Legolas", "gravatar_hash": "ac3ef7b5ec4ec123ac7bacb1543dacf3", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 07, 2010", "message": "What Hakon said: Allow a question to be also published on multiple sites.
