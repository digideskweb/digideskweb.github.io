My (admittedly limited) experience with CAS (as a client side developer) has been almost entirely negative.  Shibboleth was not investigated.\n\nThere's little to gain from using third-party systems, as there is no plan to open global login to third-party sites.  Its purely for use within the StackExchange network.  The system is actually pretty simple and accordingly quite easy to debug and deploy.\n\n@db - There are 28 main StackExchange sites (with 3 more pending creation, right now).  Joining any single site cannot be reasonably construed as a desire to join all of those communities.  It'd also be really painful to migrate the existing sites to a new user model, for essentially no gain.\n\nAlso, just because *right now* we do not treat a \"new to this site, but active on another site\" user any differently does not mean we will not in the future."}, {"author_name": "tvanfosson", "gravatar_hash": "fb599bac7c1f602a2ea455951d6da209", "author_url": "http://farm-fresh-code.blogspot.com", "date": "Sep 11, 2010", "message": "@Kevin - weird.
