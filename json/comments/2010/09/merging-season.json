It also made finding a document difficult because it could be in more than one folder.\n\nWhen we started using the wiki, life was great.  We would tag a document in multiple categories and people thinking about related category A could find the document and people searching from the point of view of category B could find it.  If an appropriate category did not exist ... created on the fly.  Good stuff.  No more agonizing over which category a doc goes in, just mark it in all the relevant categories and life is good.\n\nTo me you already have a mechanism to segment content.  The tag.  Maybe start with a broad topic like music and let the subdividing happen organically with the tags.  The problem may be that there is no way to make a \"subdomain\" of the broad topic.  Start with music.stackexchange.com. If the guitars tag grows to X number of questions (and answers) it gets it's own URL, but is still included in music for those who care about all of music.\n\nThis lets the dividing happen organically and solves the problem of having to stop and think about how to organize content up front and also lets people find stuff at the level of detail they are interested in."}, {"author_name": "SKapsal", "gravatar_hash": "2c67c702e6e2db5258c3f089a6235ca9", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 17, 2010", "message": "Also, +1 for voting a question onto a specific site (If sites will be divided)"}, {"author_name": "Eric Weilnau", "gravatar_hash": "45c914d730cef4110c3d790f03c31cfc", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 17, 2010", "message": "Much of what Joel says in this post seems reasonable to me.

It is one of the least useful sites of the network. Even though it might be one of the most entertaining. \n\nWhen compared to other sites, there is an incredible amount of noise on Programmers, and not anywhere as much signal. Sure, to some extent that's by definition. However, the five on-topic questions that had been selected on Area51 at least sounded promising, if highly subjective. Right now, many questions are subjective and... well, that's it. They have no other defining qualities and bear no value whatsoever, to anyone on this planet. They are nothing but random polls, not helpful at all in \\making the Internet a better place for finding good answers to specific questions\\.\n\nMind you, there are also questions that *are* useful, such as, oh say, what keyboards are ergonomic, or how to talk to pointy-haired bosses (or lovely ladies), or whether job hopping will look bad on your resume. But even those questions are extremely broad, and the only answer you can reasonably take from (or give to) them is \\it depends\\. \n\nSo you read everybody's answers, you pat everybody on the back, and it makes you feel good as well. But at the end of the day, you walk away not having really learned that much, if anything at all. For a Q&amp;A site, that's abysmal.\n\nProgrammers is just one step short of becoming a Digg/Reddit clone. That's some extreme criticism right there, but so are the problems.\n\nI am not dismissing Programmers completely; having a place for that water-cooler nonsense is great \u2014 but I also feel that we are misusing the SE platform. The site, as it is, is not a good fit for StackExchange; and StackExchange, as it is, is not a good fit for the site.\n\nAnd it's beginning to dawn on people; on the community itself. Just look at meta.programmers. Ten days into the public beta, there are already quite a few discussions going on about how the SE engine could be changed to better suit the community. As if the community was somehow forced to use that engine to begin with. Out of a million possibilities, we consciously picked SE, and now we suddenly want to \\improve\\ it in all kinds of funky ways. Suggestions range from removing the ability to mark anything as Community Wiki to getting rid of the ability to accept answers.\n\nI think that speaks volumes. We are reinventing the wheel.\n\nCoincidentally, that's the main reason why merging a couple of more serious proposals into Programmers won't really fix anything. In and on itself, merging is an excellent idea. But this particular site is just too different from everything else. Painting stripes on a unicorn will not make it a zebra; it will make it a very sad unicorn and waste lots of paint.\n\nThe list of merge candidates for Programmers reads really weird. To expand on your very own metaphor, you have this motley crew having fun at the water cooler, and those Health IT specialists and software lawyers impatiently waiting on the doorstep, keen to discuss dead serious stuff. And you walk them over to the water cooler and tell them, \\You are all friends now! Talk to each other! I'll be off then!\\\n\nP.S.: I am also not quite sure about merging the vi proposal and the Emacs proposal with a site that is all about subjective questions such as which editor is the best ever.

A bit like a game of chess.  There are very real, very complex (and somewhat arbitrary) rules but - within these - players can do as they wish.\n\nThis is something I called \"Orchestrated Freedom\".  Real freedom very quickly gets chaotic and death-by-committee is sure to follow.\n\nThe reason StackOverflow works is that you have a simple and clear set of rules for creation and answering of questions, as well as rewarding the authority of individual users.  When it came time to create new StackOverflows you essentially threw the rules out and created a free-for-all.  Anyone can create a new group and so everyone did.  I think you just need a new set of tools that can be accessed by those with sufficiently high authority (again, an arbitrary choice set by an external \"orchestrator\").\n\nHere are some ideas:\n\n- Questions can be migrated from one StackOverflow to another by votes by high-authority users;\n- When sufficient questions have been migrated to other sites then users can vote to merge entirely (and not necessarily with only one site);\n- Should insufficient users vote then the process continues until activity drops below an arbitrary limit whereupon everything is automatically migrated;\n- Those who migrate between Stacks can maintain their authority derived from migrated questions (potentially with some discount);\n- You may also wish to permit questions to migrate from popular sites to new sites (but perhaps with a greater level of voting to achieve) so that sufficiently complex Stacks can split and differentiate if required.\n\nWhat this would mean is that you don't automatically have to worry about what works with what but ensure that users know which stacks are posing similar questions and allow straightforward migration.\n\nIn addition, I would also recommend a process of \"forgetting\".  I think it may be useful for ensuring that sites don't become dominated by old \"crusty\" members if authority is maintained only for a year, with a fall-off on authority gained more than a year previously until it goes to zero for any points gained more than two years previously.  This allows a more organic movement between Stacks and ensures that only the most consistent recent supporters manage the site (and are not limited in necessary changes by those with tremendous scores who are not similarly engaged).\n\nThanks for a fantastic service and looking forward to seeing what happens next."}, {"author_name": "Alex Githatu", "gravatar_hash": "247360911b4919a1d820f43d469fea07", "author_url": "http://alextheafrican.wordpress.com", "date": "Sep 19, 2010", "message": "I was also surprised like many here at how big Taco is!\n\nNow I'm no expert on how communities are built, but I feel smaller groupings make more sense as part of a larger community.

I have this dilema with one of my proposals.  @Vince has incorrectly restated rule 3.  The point IS in fact to \"not create such a big group that you don't have enough experts to answer all the questions.\"  Take my proposed site, for instance.  I have proposed a site for Computational Chemistry.  There has been a site proposed for Chemistry as well (which is, very literally, the size of an academic department at a university), though it about 1/3 as many followers as computational chemistry.  There is a fairly well established listserv for computational chemistry called CCL, which dates back to 1991 and has an estimated 3000 daily readers.  About 80% of the posts on CCL would make perfect StackExchange questions (the problem with CCL, of course, is that it is a mailing list, and a very old one at that, so everyone on the list gets every question asked in their inbox).  The problem with merging computational chemistry into Chemistry is that 98% of the questions on a Chemistry Q&amp;A site would be from high school students wanting to know how to do basic stoichiometry.  This is what I would call the \"Yahoo Answers effect\" Experts certainly don't have time to answer thousands of high school chemistry questions.  \n\nSo my question would be: how big does an online community need to be to justify a dedicated SE site?  A computational chemistry site might get 1,000 to 10,000 daily views in the best case scenario, but it would hold pretty steady there.

No one ever asked us if we wanted a separate PHP site. The option was never on the table because *you* had decided it was a Bad Idea. And it was. But if you had asked, I'm willing to bet my left arm that tens of thousands of PHP programmers would have said YES PLEASE! (and in the case of PHP, the rest of us might have agreed, but that's beside the point ;))\n\nI think what you're really missing is some layer of abstraction between the proposals that are made, and the sites that are created. The community is good at saying what it is interested in, but that's not necessarily what it *needs*, or what would actually work in practice.\n\nFor example, when users said \"we want a Unix site\" and \"we want an Ubuntu site\", perhaps the solution would have been not to merge or leave alone, but rather to transform them into two different sites.\n\nObviously, the Ubuntu users didn't feel they'd be served properly on a Unix site. Why not? Maybe the focus of the site is wrong. It's not so much that it's not exclusive to Ubuntu (since that could be handled with a simple tag). The problem is that the two sites appeal to different *kinds* of users.\n\nMaybe it'd have worked if those two proposals had been transformed into \"Linux-users\" and \"Linux-hackers\", for example. The reason why Ubuntu users didn't want to use the Unix site was that they felt Unix sites tended to focus too much on scripting things yourself, hacking, messing around with the system, while the Ubuntu users just wanted their computer to *work*.\n\nThe Ubuntu users didn't sign up simply because they use Ubuntu on their computers. They did so because they wanted a place to get simple, not-too-technical answers to their questions of how to make Ubuntu do X or work with Y. The uniting trait is not that they *have* Ubuntu, but that they want to *do* something with it.\n\nThat was how the original trilogy worked: All those interested in programming and writing software, go here. All those who are tasked with keeping stuff running by any means necessary, go that way. And those of you who just want your own computer to work, use this site\". We don't care *which* language you're programming in, StackOverflow is where you need to be. And it doesn't matter what kind of servers you're running, you need to be on ServerFault.\n\nThat certainly wasn't the division the community would have proposed if you'd asked.\n\nThe trilogy works because it divides people based on the activity they're interested in, rather than by the arbitrary set of bits on their harddrives. Call it Windows, Gentoo or OSX, it doesn't matter. If the problem is \"I need to configure my server to do X\", you have one place to go, and if the problem is \"I need to write a program that does Y\", you have another site.\n\nA sysadmin won't be much help for someone asking about Matlab programming, even if said Matlab instance is running on the same OS as the sysadmin's server.\n\nBut a Java programmer can contribute when a Python programmer asks how he should organize his code, or when a beginner in some other language asks what recursion means. Programmers have a skillset in common regardless of which language they're using. Sysadmins have skills in common, whether they're Unix or Windows people.\n\nThe same goes for the Music thing: maybe the best solution isn't simply to merge some of the sites, and leaving others alone. Maybe they have to be all merged together, and then split again along a different axis. Is the community going to suggest this? Probably not. So who is?\nWho does each site appeal to? What do their users want to *do*? Do they want to play music? Do they want to be in a successful band? Do they want to learn music theory? Do they want to *write* music? It's not really the guitar that's important, it's the fact that you want to learn to play an instrument.\n\nThe gamedev site suffers the same problem. It's targeted at people who are interested in \"game development\", but lots of people are, and they don't have a lot in common.\nThere are people who are interested in *programming* games, there are people who are interested in making the art for a game, people who are interested in designing games, and so on. Each of these groups has some kind of internal focus, an activity they can all relate to, and where they're all able to help each others. But the game programmer and game artist don't really have that much in common in terms of the activities they perform, or care about. They are interested in the same end product, sure, but there's no overlap between them as far as the activities they want to do to get there.\n\nAs for the programmers site, who is it *for*? The reason it's such a watercooler thing at the moment is that that's basically how it looks from the outside. We have StackOverflow for discussing the actual activity of programming. Programmers.SE is for what... discussing the *profession* of being a programmer? That *does* sound like something you do at the water cooler.\n\nAnd merging it with the ones listed doesn't really make sense. Then we'd have a site for... discussing being a programmer as well as being an Emacs user?\n\nisn't it a pretty good rule of thumb that the good, successful sites, focus on a verb, on an activity, rather than an object, or a \"thing\"?\n\nServerfault isn't about servers, it's about \"managing servers\". SO isn't about code, it's about programming.\nMathOverflow is for those doing math and solving math problems, not for those who want to talk about being mathematicians. (and it's not for any specific math \"thing\" either. We don't need a site just for square roots). \n\nThe Gadgets site failed because it was about a thing (well, a lot of things), rather than an activity. As such, there's no clear skillset to focus on. Lots of people own a gadget, but that doesn't mean they know anything about it, or can contribute to a Q&amp;A site.\n\nThe Ubuntu site isn't really about Ubuntu, it's about *making Ubuntu run, and serve your needs*. The Unix site isn't really about Unix, it's about messing around with Unix, and hacking it to do what you need. Those are the focal points that really unite the site's community. We might all be Ubuntu users, but that doesn't give us anything to talk about. What does give us something to talk about is that we're all trying to get our computer to work properly.\n\nSo two questions it might be worth asking about prospective sites:\n\n- is the site about a verb or a noun? Is it about programming or about C++? About \"making stuff work\" or about the stuff itself? The former is good, the latter should serve as a major warning sign.\n\n- if I click on a random question under a random tag, will I understand what's going on, and be able to learn something or contribute something? I've only ever written a couple of lines in Ruby, and certainly wouldn't be able to tell you why your Ruby code doesn't work. But I *can* see that it is code, and make a guess of what it does, so I might learn something from it. And if the question isn't too specific to Ruby, I might be able to answer as well. A guitar player will likely be able to understand what's going on if he clicks on a question under the Piano tag. But a game programmer clicking on a random game artist question is pretty worthless."}, {"author_name": "tion", "gravatar_hash": "35f44419aee0597f378e2d67d2f08f22", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 20, 2010", "message": "I went to Newton South.

The URL used to access the site can provide this.  For example, if you used the URL \"programming.overflow.com\", the the \"programming\" tag would be implied - you would only see posts with that tag and that tag would be added explicitly for any new posts you make.\n\nExtending this to multiple tags in the URL supports the idea that \"communities consist of concentric circles\".

They use a top-down methodology, This approach creates boundaries and rules that are not all-encompassing. People often leave if it does not fit (hence the hundreds of php bbs).\n\nOn the other site are the communities, that often appear and grow organically without the boundaries of engineering. Some called this anarchic. Well in some sense it is, but it is not without rules. It is anarchic in the old greek sense. The rules are made implicitly by the community itself, not by some \"Gods\" looking over the community. See also my comments at <a href=\"http://drupal.txwikinger.me.uk/content/evolution-does-not-follow-path-guided-scientific-categories\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://drupal.txwikinger.me.uk/content/evolution-does-not-follow-path-guided-scientific-categories</a>\n\nIn some way, I believe the whole area51 concept has thrown stackoverflow into a dichotomy. As long there was only the trilogy, there was a high form of control for the broad rules. Area51 promised in some way that if you find a topic and a community supporting it, there will be a site. This is in some ways like Thomas Mann's Wizzard's apprentice. You easily call spirits that you will not be able to control.\n\nAnd I believe this is exactly the issue that is now going on. The expectations of the old guard is totally different than the expectations of the new wave of communities coming in. \n\nI also believe that the trilogy was a different kind of beast, because even with three sides, the community was more or less of one type. It was all about using computers. The division into three sites is more a super-tag.\n\nNow the communities are starting to be far more diverse. Hence the general way of engineering things will not always work anymore.\n\nI don't know what the solution  to this problem is. I see basically two ways out of this problem. One is to go back to traditional tight control and top-down \"engineering\" approach. However, this will loose a lot of communities that do not fit into this kind of philosophy. \n\nThe other way is to open up and trying to start to learn what diversity really means and what it demands. This will not be easy, the US melting pot tries this for a couple of centuries and has not succeeded in it yet (maybe in truth it is not tried and that is why it is not succeeding). This will look more anarchic (but will still have its own implicit rules), it would be more evolutionary than planned. It will not prevent communities to grow together (and merge) or others to split. However, this way things are tested by real life and mistakes are corrected later.\n\nThe alternative does not allow to ever know what works and what works not, because the decisions are made on preconceived notions, or stereotypes. Diversity cannot exists under prejudice and stereotypes, the communities attracted will still be very homogeneous.\n\nI do not know which way is better, these are two different ways that both might be right in some way. However, maybe in the end, both ways will be walked in any way, because ideas cannot be monopolized. Even Microsoft could not prevent Linux to rise up. In the same way, if communities don't feel welcomed, they might just fork and go outside stackexchange.\n \nIn any way, there is an interesting future ahead."}, {"author_name": "David Rivers", "gravatar_hash": "9ae9258789a5fff2df62379a51cbe22f", "author_url": "http://davidrivers.name", "date": "Sep 25, 2010", "message": "Is it possible that if more people were aware of how to efficiently use the tag system, then they would desire less to create faction sites?

In my opinion there should be a common architecture for all \"Stack\" sites, so that the questions and their answers are stored in a common repository. Then the sites like StackOverflow, ServerFault, SuperUser, and all Area51 experiments are just some selections from those, based on some clustering criteria. Tags are good metadata to do the clustering.\n\nThis would be a solution for all the problems you mentioned above. It's more natural also a bottom-up approach, scalable, and future proof... if taxonomies evolve (specialized, generalized, become obsolete, or created) it is only needed to refactor the clustering query. Most importantly, the set of questions on the sites don't have to be disjoint. One given question does not belong to just only one site exclusively.\n\ne.g. if the Ubuntu community wants their own site, it can be created by specifying some selection criteria. If someone adds a question to the Ubuntu site, it will be visible on the Unix site also, but not the opposite.\n\nI like how the Bazaar version control system handles the revisions in a shared repository: each branch is just a view/selection of all the revisions in the repository.\n\nHope my ideas help."}, {"author_name": "Mike Schinkel", "gravatar_hash": "81df87e0d3e269d6fa6a17c6914fd656", "author_url": "http://mikeschinkel.com", "date": "Sep 28, 2010", "message": "@Joel: I think you are completely off-base and further think you and your team painted yourself into a corner.\n\nFirst, this idea that forcing people into a larger community *given your current site architecture* flies in the face of decades of research in sociology. People want to create communities where they get to focus on the things that matter to them and when in those community they participate. Put them in a large community with too much noise and they go silent. \n\nAs evidenced I'm currently interested in WordPress. I've got a good reputation on the WordPress Answers site but a trivial reputation on StackOverflow even though SO has more WordPress questions than on WordPress Answers. FYI, my current rep on WA it's 4194, on SO it's 310:\n\nhttp://wordpress.stackexchange.com/users/89/mikeschinkel\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/users/102699/mikeschinkel\n\nIf you merge sites, I'll just stop contributing and I'll bet there are a lot more people like me than there are people who want to participate in a larger community. Yes, you have many on SO who want a larger community, but I'd compare SO's user base with Facebook's user base and say the latter want smaller communities, not larger ones. After all, Facebook has beat the 90-9-1 rule by getting far more than 10% actively contributing. How many SO users actually answer questions vs. just lurk?\n\nAs for painted yourself into a corner you've done so by launching multiple sandboxed sites. Compare to Quora which is a single site. I like the way your sites \"feel\" a lot better but Quora can scale in ways you'll never be able to. I see two options for StackExchange:\n\n1.) Stop this silliness about trying to force people into larger groups and allow as many niche communities as will have a reasonable number of users.\n\nOR\n\n2.) Follow what both Daniel Paull and Daniel Dinnyes suggested and merge ALL sites into StackExchange.com and allow them to have subdomain and even domain aliases like http://stackoverflow.com for specific communities. Provide a community process to \"promote\" tags to categories (following the WordPress model of tags and categories) and a category becomes a \"site.\"  Let users associate themselves with one or more categories/sites so that on StackExchange.com they see only those things that are related to their interests, or if they go to one of the subdomains/domain aliases they see only the things for  category/site *including* the question list and user reputation list being filtered for that category/site. IOW, allow the creation of sandboxes that people can play and and filter out all of the noise.\n\nSo here's my prediction: either you'll pursue #1 or #2, or you'll be eclipsed by something like Quora, and StackExchange will never make the transition into the public consciousness that companies like Google, Yahoo, Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia and more have made. Continue on the current path and you'll just be an \"also ran.\" I hope that's not the case, because I love WordPress Answers, but I see the writing on the wall if you continue down the path of trying to force everyone into larger communities.\n\nJMTCW.\n\n-Mike\n\nP.S. In addition to @Daniel Paull and @Daniel Dinnyes I though @Ian Ringrose, @Gavin Chait and @David Hollman all had really great comments/suggestions.\n\nP.P.S. @jalf I disagree with you about PHP; I'd love to have a PHP Answers site separate from StackOverflow.
