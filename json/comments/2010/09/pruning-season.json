See the discussion at http://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/354/1/stack-exchange-20-and-what-this-means-for-mathoverflow/ . In particular, our understanding is that migrating to 2.0 would means that our moderators would no longer get full database dumps, which would make it impossible for us to ever move to a competing open source product. We are uncomfortable with the idea that we would have no backup option if SE became bankrupt or evil.\n\nMany of us hope that we can work out a deal which will allow us to take advantage of the new SE 2.0 features while addressing the linked concerns. If not, we will have to rely on Robert Cartaino's <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/page/11\" rel=\"nofollow\">promise</a>\nthat \"any site that maintains enough traffic will be allowed to continue. SE 1.0 sites owners meeting the minimum criteria will have a choice:\n\n    * Continue for free under the same terms as SE 1.0 for as long as they maintain the traffic levels.\n    * Migrate directly into SE 2.0 as a fully-fledged SE 2.0 site.\"\n\nWe at MO certainly hope that our 50 questions a day, with a 99% answer rate, will be considered enough traffic."}, {"author_name": "Liam", "gravatar_hash": "faf9707decc36ef2b987bfb120af9e3b", "author_url": "http://www.LiamBateman.net", "date": "Sep 16, 2010", "message": "@patrick\n\nIsnt that a complete rip off of SO?"}, {"author_name": "jalf", "gravatar_hash": "5794f28dc1aba7a8844933816a6fa2c9", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 17, 2010", "message": "@Liam: certainly looks like it.
