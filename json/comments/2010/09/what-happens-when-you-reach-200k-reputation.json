He's been getting 500+ pretty regularly... I had a good week in the middle of August, achieving 500 on three days (whereas I think I'd previously only done it twice in *total*) - but Nick still whooped me thoroughly.\n\nDo I regret suggesting the weekly/monthly leagues way back before Meta even existed? Not a chance.\n\nI would like to smugly point out that if Nick beats me by 3000 points every month from now on, I can still relax for about 3 years though ;) On the other hand, if I were to just stop now he'd catch up *relatively soon... I don't intend to do that, of course.\n\nRight, back to SO... (well, preparing a church service for Sunday actually, but I'm sure SO will distract me periodically)."}, {"author_name": "systempuntoout", "gravatar_hash": "97b24d533eab5a093a1085903745b33c", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 01, 2010", "message": "I can't believe it, that's amazing!
