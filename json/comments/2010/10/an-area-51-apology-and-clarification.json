If a narrow site is proposed first (say, Ubuntu), and then, a month later, someone proposes a Gentoo site. Or a Debian site, or a Red Hat site. With the current tools, your only option is to allow all these similar sites because none of them are a subset of the others, so merging one into the other makes no sense. But the ideal solution had been for a single \"Linux Distros\" site to be created, into which they could *all* be merged.\n\nSuppose instead of StackOverflow, you'd initially created a .NET-Overflow. Then the logical way to go would be to expand that site, add Java, then C++, then Python, and so on, until it eventually becomes \"everything programming\". But the tools for this are missing. A51 is still \"first come first serve\". So creating a narrow site today might actually prevent or hinder the creation of a broader site that could include it tomorrow.\n\nOf course, I'm not sure how this should be pulled off without stepping on anyone's toes. But I think the scenario is important. We're already seeing proposed sites that aren't a strict subset of an existing site, so the current one-way merging process doesn't work, but they have enough overlap that it'd make sense to combine them with another site, creating a new one with a broader scope than either of the two \"source\" sites."}, {"author_name": "jalf", "gravatar_hash": "5794f28dc1aba7a8844933816a6fa2c9", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 01, 2010", "message": "@Barry Kelly: then split it up.\n\nThe language design part doesn't make much sense on SO, no. But the software engineering aspects of actually building a compiler would work fine there.\n\nSo perhaps instead of a compiler design SE site, you should propose a language design one? One that focuses specifically on the theoretical aspect, which isn't well supported by SO. And then leave the practical implementation parts to SO?\n\nAs for Vim, I'm not sure, but it might be considered a subset of Superuser? It does seem like creating a Vim site opens the door for a million tool-specific sites: one for Emacs, one for Visual Studio, one for Notepad, and so on. Do they all go on SuperUser? Should a Developer Tools site be created that can contain them all? I'm not sure, just thinking out loud. :)\n\n\"What about Scrum, Healthcare IT, Drupal, White Hat SEO?\"\nWouldn't it make sense to merge Scrum into a general \"Software Development Methodologies\" site (which would require such a site to be created first, of course? And the SEO one seems like it could be merged into one of the web-oriented sites, but again, one of them might need to expand its scope to accommodate it.\n\nHealthcare IT is an odd beast, and I'm really not sure how it should be tackled. I've seen some fairly sensible arguments in comments here justifying its existence, but it still seems like there's got to be *something* more general it can be folded into.\n\nPerhaps before entering the commitment phase, every site proposal should be considered for generalization: whenever a very specific proposal is about to enter commitment, someone needs to ask \"could this be broadened to catch upcoming sister sites as well?\" I'm not sure if this should be done by official staff, the A51 community or the specific proposal's community (although I'm currently thinking the A51 community as a whole might make sense). But *someone* (someone who is familiar with the SE platform) should be required to sign off on a proposal before it leaves Definition, basically saying \"I/we believe the scope of this site to be broad enough to prevent near-identical site sprawl\" in the future. That might counter the tendency of domain experts to define \"their\" site as narrowly as possible. All the people normally participating in the Definition phase are those who are interested in this very specific subject, so their natural tendency is to narrow the site down to focus on that, and nothing else. So maybe every site needs some external input as well: \"couldn't this Ubuntu site be broadened to cover the same thing for every Linux distro?\" \"Couldn't this Web Dev site be broadened to include SEO aspects as well?\" and so on.\n\nRunning a check like that might have avoided a lot of the merging pain that people are going to have to deal with now.\n\nAgain, just thinking out loud here.\n\nAnyway, looks like the A51 process is becoming a lot saner, so good job on that. ;)"}, {"author_name": "Robert", "gravatar_hash": "8412e434f40996cca46ca6c260aa9dd0", "author_url": "http://creatingcode.com", "date": "Oct 01, 2010", "message": "Classy apology.

According to the SO FAQ, \"Avoid asking questions that are subjective, argumentative, or require extended discussion. This is not a discussion board, this is a place for questions that can be answered!\"  Language design questions quite clearly fall into the subjective realm, but even many compiler implementation questions are difficult to fit into that category - but are still very much acceptable for a programming language group.\n\nPerhaps the current proposal is too close to being a duplicate, but maybe instead of simply closing it, something could be done to shape the portion that should broken apart from SO so that it would be acceptable. I ask you, Jeff, if I (or George) started a language design SE proposal would that be closed too? Would there be any programming related questions acceptable or would it have to be strictly theoretical?"}, {"author_name": "jalf", "gravatar_hash": "5794f28dc1aba7a8844933816a6fa2c9", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 04, 2010", "message": "@configurator et al:\nwhich compiler questions aren't on-topic for StackOverflow? Which compiler question would get closed there?\n\nAs for StackOverflow's compiler tag, I agree with you, it's not used for compiler design, but for compilation issues.

There\u2019s a high probability that users of site [StackOverflow] would enjoy seeing the occasional question about [Compiler]\u201d\nOnce again, no, I think there really isn\u2019t.\"\nI think there is. :)\nSO is big. There are a lot of newbie programmers who just want to know how to implement a binary tree, but there are *also* a lot of people interested in language theory, compiler design, semantics and everything else under the sun. There are a lot of people who are interested in practically *everything*.\nAnd there are already so many different subjects covered on So, *and no one objects*. No one have complained about all those dirty Python questions all over the place when they're trying to share information on SQL. No one objects to the homework questions being on the same website as questions about algorithmic time complexity. So why would anyone object to questions about compiler design?\n\nDo you actually use SO much? It seems that non-users have a hard time accepting that they don't get a nice comfy bubble to isolate them from \"all the others\", but my experience is that it's rarely necessary. If a SO user doesn't want to read compiler questions, he'll typically only read questions within his 2-3 preferred tags. If there actually was a problem with people not wanting to see \"foreign\" questions on their site, it would have surfaced long ago. It hasn't.\n\nThere are a lot of people on SO who'd be interested in compiler design questions. And these people would be able to discover them *if they're asked on SO*. Being on SO gives your subject/community a lot of free publicity.\n\nI'm not really sure what the big deal with communities is. SO works because communities *appear* there. They aren't \"created\" by SO, they don't \"evolve\" there specifically. But people with a common interest eventually find their way there, and that's really all the community you need. The C++ experts community on C++ isn't there because anyone said \"let's evolve a community\". But a handful of very knowledgeable C++ users ended up using the site. And they don't need special community features to stay in touch. You just look in the [C++] tag, and the people providing good answers are the ones you need.\n\nWhy wouldn't the same work for compiler questions?\n\nIn short, I think the compiler people need to worry less about communities, and more about asking and answering questions. If you do that, then a quasi-community *appears*. But I think what makes the SE sites work is that they're not focused on the community. They're focused on the questions and answers, and the community appears around that as a side effect. I think that's a good thing, even for compilers.\n\nWhy do you feel that compiler design specifically needs a separate website/frontend?"}, {"author_name": "Robert Harvey", "gravatar_hash": "1233ec65168f4aae4d939ae8fe6cde1e", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 04, 2010", "message": "@Jalf:\n\nIf you're not a coffee drinker, the following analogy may escape you, but...\n\nThink of the Compiler Design site (or the MathOverflow site) as a Starbucks coffee house.\n\nNow you may agree or disagree about whether or not Starbucks makes good coffee, but what you can agree to is that fans of Starbucks are devoted.  They will go out of their way to find a Starbucks to get their morning cup of coffee.  And I'm not talking about the grande-lattee-frappe foo-foo drinks either; I'm talking about their core product: a tall house-blend for a buck and a half.\n\nHere's two things I know about Starbucks:\n\n1.  They didn't become Starbucks by putting their coffee on the shelf in the supermarket next to the Yuban and the Folgers.  They have their own store fronts.\n\n2.  Everyone who is a fan knows about the Starbucks they went to where the teenagers working there got it wrong.  They measured the coffee wrong, or they didn't clean the urns; they did something to screw up their perfect cup of coffee.  In short, they are amateurs.\n\nThe Compiler Design site differs from MathOverflow in one important respect: Programmers who are not specifically compiler designers can learn a whole lot from compiler design principles.  Like the barista who needs a mentor, the average programmer needs the compiler designers to show them the inner sanctum.\n\nBut you still have to attract the real experts, and I am not convinced that StackOverflow (in its present state) is an effective storefront.
