The last step was really the most important one.  And indeed, it makes a lot of sense when you think about it.  If we're ready to reject Joel's broader assertion that all sites need unique domains, we could consider instead only rejecting the narrower assertion that all sites need to be .coms.  After all, Wikipedia is a .org.  Craigslist is a .org.  Imageshack is a .us.  If you look at the top 500 sites you'll see quite a number - albeit a minority - that are not .com.  Part of the team's argument is that search engines don't care about your domain name, so why does it need to be .com?\n\nUltimately I know this isn't going to change anyone's mind, but just for the hell of it I'm going to repeat my compromise proposed yesterday on *cough*Seasoned Advice*cough*, which is:\n\nGive us awesomename.stackexchange.com (instead of generictopicname.stackexchange.com) with a redirect from awesomename.com or awesomename.org or whatever.  That way we can still brand the site and try to recruit new members without feeling shame or causing confusion, you can still get every last drop of search engine juice, and the migration path is totally clear so there won't be mass confusion or arguments when we finally do reach \"privileged\" traffic levels and the team finally decides to give us an actual domain.\n\nThis assumes that a decent name has been chosen, but I think without the .com restrictions, that's much easier to do."}, {"author_name": "BDP", "gravatar_hash": "297c8649d7bf3722b331469315dcc665", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 05, 2010", "message": "This is a pretty good article.

Internally you are no doubt having mind-numbing never-ending discussions on this topic and talking yourselves around in circles. Fun times. Wanna know the best part? You're not going to come up with a satisfying solution, no matter how long you talk about it.\n\nIf you and Joel had some of these mind-numbing discussions on a podcast for all of the key community members to hear (plus everyone else), then they would better understand both sides of the argument and would be less critical of the decisions that get made because they would know exactly how hard it was to make any decision at all -- never mind the \"right\" one.\n\nIn addition to that, the original Stack Overflow Podcast was interesting because it was a behind the scenes look at the building of a new startup and listeners were exposed to many discussions that enlightened them on why certain difficult decisions were made. You guys argued about decisions in public and no doubt the listeners agreed and disagreed at times, but either way, they were aware of the pros/cons for each decision were.\n\nNow the SO podcast had a programming bent, but the SE podcast can have a building-communities bent -- and even if it's only listened to by a few thousand hardcore members -- those few thousand members will be more supportive of you because they'll have some inside knowledge on how the decisions were made.\n\nThose few thousand listeners will be the engine that powers your communities and backs you up when mistakes are made."}, {"author_name": "Eric Wilson", "gravatar_hash": "d7f82cba9dbc95e901b4280ab315bbf1", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 07, 2010", "message": "Can I upvote Rowan?\n\nIf Joel won't do it, maybe a Robert and Jeff podcast would work, since he spends his day thinking about community issues . . . so long as he can forcefully disagree with his boss in public."}, {"author_name": "Eric Wilson", "gravatar_hash": "d7f82cba9dbc95e901b4280ab315bbf1", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 07, 2010", "message": "How about a Jeff and Robert podcast?"}, {"author_name": "Alexander Pas", "gravatar_hash": "ca5fd69395f0422a8c9ef11db8bb29ca", "author_url": "http://dropdev.org", "date": "Oct 07, 2010", "message": "we need the ability to upvote comments in this blag!"}, {"author_name": "Mike Schinkel", "gravatar_hash": "81df87e0d3e269d6fa6a17c6914fd656", "author_url": "http://mikeschinkel.com", "date": "Oct 09, 2010", "message": "In general I think you've taken the right approach. However let me mention two things to consider addressing as you move forward.\n\n1.) The long domain names are a lot to type. \n\nFor the site I moderate WordPress Answers the http://wordpress.stackexchange.com requires typing on the browser line all of \"wordpress\" and then the . and then at least \"s\" to get my browser cache to match. It may seem trivial but when I type if probably 20 times a day it gets tedious (yes, I could use a shortcut etc. but I also type it in emails and so on.)  Coming up with shorter names, maybe as shortcuts would be helpful.  \n\nFor example, if you were to add http://wp.stackexchange.com (for our site) it would be a lot easier.  Also, maybe the owner of http://www.se.com will sell and you could then offer shortcuts like http://wp.se.com. :-)\n\nI've research URL design so I know that whatever you do has downsides, I'm just giving you some thoughts I hope you'll consider on the subject.\n\n2.) It's awkward to reference the generic site name when writing answers because the generic site name often conflicts when the subject of what you are writing.  For example \"If you have questions about WordPress and can't find the answers anywhere else be sure to go to WordPress Answers and ask your questions there\" and \"If this answer solves your problem sure to come back to WordPress Answers to mark it as the correct answer.\"  \n\nCompare those to following using the name \"query_posts\" that we voted up: \"If you have questions about WordPress and can't find the answers anywhere else be sure to go to query_posts and ask your questions there\" and \"If this answer solves your problem be sure to come back to query_posts to mark it as the correct answer.\"  These latter ones make it easier to write clearly.\n\nProbably the most workable solution is to elevate the StackExchange brand such we can write the following: \"If you have questions about WordPress and can't find the answers anywhere else be sure to go to StackExchange and ask your questions there\" and \"If this answer solves your problem be sure to come back to StackExchange to mark it as the correct answer.\"  These latter ones make it easier to write clearly.  It just needs to be clear when the come to StackExchange where they should go from there.\n\nAnyway, hope this helps.\n\n-Mike"}, {"author_name": "BradC", "gravatar_hash": "c5c2165949f71bcd1fafbd8e694ab5f2", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 10, 2010", "message": "So, how does askubuntu.com rate an exception to this new policy?"}, {"author_name": "Andy", "gravatar_hash": "e5906408c4fc2a0489827ce6ed2bc091", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 18, 2010", "message": "&gt; is that making changes without announcing them a priori shows that...\n\nYou keep using that word.
