Previously, the mechanics and policies were scattered between the FAQ page and various [faq] questions on meta. The new privileges pages clearly state when it is appropriate or not to close, delete, and flag, and when a post becomes a wiki, which was not at all self-explanatory. It should be linked to from the FAQ page (once they're finalized)."}, {"author_name": "Jakub Nar\u0119bski", "gravatar_hash": "672aa8b373071ef9f06db563d1c08d77", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 08, 2010", "message": "It would be nice to have link to privileges page on one owns user page."}, {"author_name": "John Gietzen", "gravatar_hash": "5dc3d1e5f2b7676837fdd1fb34b1db15", "author_url": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/57986/john-gietzen", "date": "Oct 08, 2010", "message": "Sweet!
