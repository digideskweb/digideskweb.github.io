If it's not interesting, I'm not looking. It's not binary; the opportunity is compared to my current position, and if it's sufficiently better, then I'll consider it.\n\nIf you want to filter for people who are \"currently looking\", no matter the quality of the messages sent to them, you're going to filter for poor quality candidates. Good quality candidates aren't going to be \"looking\" for long.

Great suggestion, we'll give that a try.\n\n@Barry: Many thanks for your thoughts. I agree that the whole messaging system needs work and that it should be easier to assess if the presented opportunity is of interest. But even if not, unless it's outright spam, I'd hope someone would send a \"thanks but no thanks\" back (we'll put a big button in place for that at some point). What I was talking about is people that simply do not respond at all to a message, one way or another, not whether the candidate is actively looking.\n\nI'm not entirely sure that only poor quality candidates and the desperate would pimp up their profile, but assuming this to be true, the employer has a very powerful opposing indicator: the stack overflow rep and the questions and answers provided by that candidate.\n\nThere's no clear cut answer yet, but the more we'll talk about this the clearer the desired outcome and mechanisms to get there will become. And then when we'll put them in place we'll probably find that they were not quite right (thanks to our very involved user community :)) and will adjust accordingly. \n\n@Joe? Possibly... But, every one that participates in careers benefits from elevating the level of quality, so it's in everyone's best interest to have mechanisms in place that help with that. From the individual's point of view, as long as it's clear what is required to stay visible (and it's not yet decided that we want to go down that route - a rep based scheme would be more transparent) it's up to them to keep up. That said... we have been debating the whole \"to charge or not to charge\" question as well. No resolution as of yet, but, stay tuned..."}, {"author_name": "configurator", "gravatar_hash": "483f450d6f4eb49aed37ee44a35470eb", "author_url": "http://www.compiler-design.com", "date": "Oct 14, 2010", "message": "When you get an email for a job advertisement, can you reply to that email or do you need to click a link to submit a response?
