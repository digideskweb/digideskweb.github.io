To an extent.  In one-off cases where the user didn't realize, I'm ok with it.  In cases where the user has a history of asking a lot of questions, not doing any searching, and posting duplicates, I'm not ok with it.\n\nWhy? Because that user is gaining reputation and I'm not entirely sure they've 'earned' it.  This isn't Slashdot, where 'Karma' doesn't mean anything: Here it means a lot.  For better or worse, people that don't know the system will equate higher reputation with better programmer, and since you equate the two (using Stack Overflow Careers) it's possible for you to be complicit in that. Even us. We're all complicit, but some of us care more than others.\n\nProblem #3\n\nWe've already nerfed close votes, even though the community has spoken and they believe \"Duplicate\" close votes should not be nerfed: ( http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/56817/can-we-prevent-some-of-the-low-quality-questions-from-entering-our-system/56829#56829 ) and there is already evidence that people aren't able to keep up with the deluge of items opened.

Pseudo Variation\n\nThere is a number of questions that come up frequently on SO that basically just differ in one tiny implementation detail. While those appear to be different at first glance, they are really ain't.\n\nExamples of those questions are \"How to extract all [elementName] from an [HTML|XML|RSS] document\" or \"How to change the format of date [X] to [Y]\". \n\nFor those type of questions, it is irrelevant whether they ask for TR and TD or for Y-m-d and d-m-Y. They are - for any practical purpose - exact duplicates. \n\nDo we really want one question for each possible element name or date formatting option a language allows? \n\n2. Technical limitations of the search function\n\nThe most obvious limitation is searching for special characters, like +-!$@% and so on. These are operators in most, if not all, programming languages. I've seen numerous questions like \"What does [operator] mean in [language]?\". There is no way (next to using Google) to find those easily on SO, so those get duplicated frequently.\n\nThe other limitation is the search functions weird evaluation of search terms. I heavily use user:me to find answers I have given in the past. I do know what I wrote in those answers but when searching for those words I often dont get any results. As a consequence I have put less and less search terms into it, but then have to wade through three pages until I find the answer I was looking for.\n\nSo even for those users who do take the time to search SO, it's not as easy as it could be to find duplicates.\n\n3. Users simply don't care\n\nThere will always be users who simply cannot be bothered to search before asking. They will ignore the compulsory Ask Advice Page and all the suggested questions on the question input form. They will ignore the faq and they will ignore the tag wiki. They *will* ask *their* question, no matter how easy it is to find the answer.\n\nThose users alone will push the amount of duplicates in the system from \"enough\" to \"too many\". If we do not want SO to be littered with duplicates, it is crucial for the community to close these duplicates or for moderators to merge them.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not happening, because\n\n4. Questions don't get merged\n\nOf all the questions I have flagged for a possible merging, exactly one was merged. I understand that merging question takes some careful consideration than just closing them. But what good is a suggested mechanism to reduce duplicates when in practise, it is only applied in very narrow situations?\n\n5. The current system is punishing finding duplicates\n\nIssue #3 wouldn't be too much of an issue if there was enough users who actually do care how the page is supposed to run. But in reality, even the most obvious duplicate will be answered because not only do people not care about them being a duplicate, but SO offers no incentive for finding them either. \n\nI am closevoting at least five to ten questions a day; most of them for being duplicates. For a lot of these questions, searching and finding an \"appropriate\" duplicate takes longer than providing a new answer (see issue #2). This will get worse the more duplicates there are (see issue #1). But despite doing this takes more effort, I do not get anything for closevoting other than a warm fuzzy feeling that I did \"the right thing\". \n\nNow, by the time I have found and supplied a suitable duplicate, those users who simply do not care, cannot or know not about suitable duplicates, provided their own answers (see issue #4). \n\nOccasionally, low-rep users will provide the link to a possible duplicate as an answer. And guess what, there will even be people upvoting them for that.\n\nIt also doesnt help that any reputation on questions that are closed as duplicate is not awarded. People just don't closevote. And why should they, when reputation is so much more valuable?\n\nLately, that warm fuzzy feeling I had for doing my community duty is no longer strong enough to fog my brain sufficiently to ignore that I am getting punished for it. \n\nI am considering not doing my community duty anymore and simply answer whatever there is two answer. That, of course, will not help the amount of duplicates. But at least I get reputation again, which would put the fun back into SO (right now it feels like housekeeping). And maybe then I can love duplicates."}, {"author_name": "Philip Ashmore", "gravatar_hash": "9e0eaa2c822639a2f006a1700903161e", "author_url": "http://www.philipashmore.com", "date": "Feb 28, 2011", "message": "In information theory terms what you're all talking about is decreasing entropy, so less bits are required to encode the (useful) information.\n\nOne way that springs to mind is to have an answer domain.\nIndividual questions connect the problem and solution domains.
