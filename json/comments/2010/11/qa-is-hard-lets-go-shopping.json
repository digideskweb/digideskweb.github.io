Problem is, if you asked your model example question, and got that answer, you would still not be sure which camera to select.  The ISO supported on the camera almost means nothing in the 'good for low light' stakes.

I'm sure this is the same for other products that look great on paper, but just have their own flaws and quirks.\n\nIsn't there any benefit in allowing these questions?
