It has a holonomic wheel base. These sound great in theory, but I have horrible memories of trying to work with them in robotics class; any slippage means that you start drifting or rotating when you don't mean to. It didn't help that we had slippery wheels on a tile floor, and no encoders for the wheels; I hope that this one at least has a better holonomic base.\n\nAnyhow, looks pretty neat, other than the wheel setup. Hope you have fun with it!"}, {"author_name": "Greg Bray", "gravatar_hash": "da1209aa320f9bbebbf128ac6a0751d3", "author_url": "http://blog.theg2.net", "date": "Nov 01, 2010", "message": "Nice...
