In fact, I was probably mentioning this right as you were trying to shut it down, as I don't pay attention to the meta exchanges.\n\nTo me, shutting down \"identify this game\" questions is tantamount to the annoyance I get from Wikipedia deletionists - it's taking up barely any space and it's beneficial to someone, so why do you have to view it negatively?"}, {"author_name": "Kevin Fairchild", "gravatar_hash": "115c8abb0d51b57e4fa507caf196bc80", "author_url": "http://developmentgeek.com", "date": "Nov 29, 2010", "message": "Am I the only one who noticed two uses of \"gray area\" and one of \"grey area\"?"}, {"author_name": "tzenes", "gravatar_hash": "947c457cb4e5480cb8b2f09e49794834", "author_url": "http://gaming.stackexchange.com/users/102/tzenes", "date": "Nov 29, 2010", "message": "&gt; To me, shutting down \u201cidentify this game\u201d questions is tantamount to the annoyance I get from Wikipedia deletionists \u2013 it\u2019s taking up barely any space and it\u2019s beneficial to someone, so why do you have to view it negatively?\n\nMan isn't this a good point.\n\nWhat is with those Wikipedia guys anyway? What does it hurt if I add myself to Wikipedia? Why is notable such a big deal over there?  Its like they're trying to establish a reputable Encyclopedia instead of trying to cover everything....\n\nThe problem with the logic \"it's taking up barely any space\" is that I can apply it to any question no matter how bad.\n\nThis argument of Mac vs Windows is bad, but it's taking up barely any space...\n\nNon omnes possumus omnia, my Latin teacher was always quick to remind me: You can't do everything.  What she was trying to say was: we have limited time and resources and if we spread them too thin we'll fail at everything.\n\nIts very easy to look at crowd sourcing and say: *I have unlimited time and resource* and completely ignore the consequence of trying to access them.  If we let in questions which are Bad\u2122, then we risk eroding our community over time.  Even in small numbers these questions lead to erosion and quickly snow ball.  If you want a good example of snow balling, look at Game-Rec on gaming.se: its a mess.  \n\nSo there is a lot of value in nipping this in the bud, and there is a good reason I don't have an entry in Wikipedia (though I get a user page).  People need to lay off the Wikipedia moderators a little.  Sure their approach can feel Draconian, but sometimes when you're herding cats you have to be a little strict: that's the price we pay for drawing on every Tom, Dick and Harry on the [Internet](www.4chan.org)."}, {"author_name": "BlueRaja", "gravatar_hash": "460167b95ff5a363d3977ddb56cfe074", "author_url": "http://www.blueraja.com/blog", "date": "Nov 29, 2010", "message": "Er, so the new position on whether or not to close these questions is whether or not you like the user?"}, {"author_name": "Jeff Atwood", "gravatar_hash": "51d623f33f8b83095db84ff35e15dbe8", "author_url": "http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/", "date": "Nov 29, 2010", "message": "@Pablo \"Should this two points be taken into account for StackOverflow (and other sites too) ?\"\n\nIf the question is EGREGIOUSLY off-topic, then it should be closed because it is off topic!
