I think to say SO is just for source code based questions is a bit much. Virtually everything in that list is appropriate for SO. This is my gripe with it. I think to suggest that what @mario argued is just to advance Yahoo Answers is a bit flippant and a strawman. @mario isn't talking about haviing \"How is babby formed\" type questions sorted by tagging.

And the one with \"program\" in the name is NOT the one about code?  Got it.  And instead of one perfectly good site, I now have to search two?  Great.  And no privileges earned on the first have carried over to the second?  Encouraging.  And this is all good news?  Yes.  You didn't happen to hire anyone who worked on Google Instant, did you?  You know, someone capable of making a great site shoot itself in the foot?"}, {"author_name": "SSteve", "gravatar_hash": "66bc542765c1079e1dfb89dcf3b5348c", "author_url": "http://theuniversalsteve.com", "date": "Aug 23, 2011", "message": "I'm just starting to get into SO. I've been using it daily for the past month+ and have learned a lot by answering questions for others. Then I ran across Programmers. My initial reaction was that this is an unnecessary split from SO. But I decided to keep an open mind. \n\nToday I had a question about Git. I figured this would be a perfect question for Programmers, right? I'm not in front of my compiler or editor and there's no source code involved. This isn't a question about coding, it's a higher-level question about software development. \n\nSo I ask my question on Programmers (http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/103171). And what happens? It gets moved to SO.\n\nNow I'm thinking my initial reaction was right. The split between the two seems rather artificial and unnecessary. I can see splitting off SuperUser and ServerFault, but the SO/Programmers split doesn't make sense to me. I guess it's way too late to merge them back together, but I don't imagine I'll be visiting Programmers again in the foreseeable future."}, {"author_name": "Travis Dtfsu Crum", "gravatar_hash": "312f1a262d02730f008b366a396e2cac", "author_url": null, "date": "Oct 08, 2012", "message": "I think I understand the difference, but then this would just draw away from both stackoverflow and superuser, At least with how I understand it.

Things change, and in time, the best answer can become incorrect without edits. If you have separate sites for 'subjective' questions, perhaps it would be better to migrate such questions rather than closing and locking them.\n\nAnd there *is* such a thing as a correct answer to a subjective question: it's the one that best sticks to the facts and, if there's a debate, mentions both sides with NPOV. See Wikipedia. Many subjective SO questions have actually been answered in this way."}]}
