I certainly hadn't heard about it until the first day of the public beta.\n\nIt's also a very niche field. Even if every single expert in the world got on board, there'd be more visits to Stack Overflow PER-DAY. To make things worse, there are a huge range of sub-fields (\"cliques\" is not actually a bad word for them), with separate \"experts\" and many declaring that they are unique compared to all the rest.\n\nI guess the real question to ask is how is the clone (http://metaoptimize.com/qa/) surviving?"}, {"author_name": "Jeff Atwood", "gravatar_hash": "51d623f33f8b83095db84ff35e15dbe8", "author_url": "http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/", "date": "Dec 22, 2010", "message": "well, based on the description of metaoptimize:\n\n> machine learning and natural language processing, predictive analytics and business intelligence, (especially for large data sets) by Joseph Turian and colleagues\n\nI'd say that even on *that* site, AI is a niche.\n\nhttp://stats.stackexchange.com is actually what that site overlaps with most, and it's doing fine with 3x the number of questions, etc."}, {"author_name": "Joe", "gravatar_hash": "35b5e9e9ccf3bfe5ff8d22b64a5234d3", "author_url": null, "date": "Dec 22, 2010", "message": "I still can't figure out what AI was defined as.

But these are still very important things! You (Jeff) should know, after-all isn't that how coding horror got it's start? I suggest that these types of things be left off of the page, but that they should still have some area where people can find this information.  As a matter of fact I think each members profile could have an optional area, where they can post their favorite blog, book, tools, or products (ide for SO and other tools like cookware for a cooking flavor of SE for example).  People could post reviews (+ or -) and rankings for things and the \"dashboard\" view of these preferences could be shown with some type of sorting that would incorporate things like expertise (SE rep), or date since modified, and recent trends (like a new book gaining momentum for example).  \n\nThis would be a great place for the curious and aspiring visitor to find solid mentor-level resources, while keeping the main part of the site for real questions."}, {"author_name": "Rong W", "gravatar_hash": "46520d686bf3a8d42e2e43cc5d0f44e1", "author_url": null, "date": "Dec 24, 2010", "message": "Practitioners do not like the word \"Artificial Intelligence\". It has become a taboo word.\n\nIf the majority of practitioners in a particular field are sensitive to some kind of taboo (or mingling of concepts), then it shouldn't be surprising that a site gets sidelined because it broke that taboo.\n\nTo help understand the conflict, I give an example of something that practitioners will frown upon: Imagine a short introduction video that describes a machine learning scientist as someone who gives toasters and televisions the ability to think. (That video example came from a huge multi-national corporation, not SE.) Why the negative reaction? The video tries to equate smart appliances with machine learning; whereas smart appliances is considered the low-hanging fruit in the field of machine learning.\n\nLet's take a look at metaoptimize QA: \n\n&gt; machine learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, text analysis, information retrieval, search, data mining, statistical modeling, and data visualization, as well as adjacent topics.\n\nPractitioners will agree that the site's objectives are clear and appropriate.\n\nLet's look at Jeff's response:\n\n&gt; I\u2019d say that even on *that* site, AI is a niche. http://stats.stackexchange.com is actually what that site overlaps with most, and it\u2019s doing fine with 3x the number of questions, etc.\n\nThis response mingled two concepts, broke one taboo, and was closed with a tone of arrogance.\n\nTo summarize: machine learning is an endangered species.

I recognize that he is merely quoting a comparison on site traffic, something which I had mis-interpreted and taken personally.)\n\n(That said, a comparison on traffic volume of two sites does not make the two sites equivalent, and does not imply that one can be a total substitute of another. This is from the point of view of the users. On the business side, things like server software stack and business models are surely interchangable.)"}]}
