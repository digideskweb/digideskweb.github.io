Forums are meant to ask a broad range of code questions in a broad range of ways.  Individuals might ask a question even if it appears in 100 other threads because they have their own twist or goal for the question in order to benefit from user replies.\n\nAlso, subjective is in the eye of the beholder.  Why the heck are people flagging posts with the reason of \"general, subjective, etc.\".  If it's not clear enough, then the poster is to modify and add and explain.  Otherwise, if there is enough context and reason for the post \"I want to ping up some experts to help guide me to the right areas of study/resources\", what's the problem with that type of forum thread or even \"Hey how can I improve performance in my code snippet here\".  Anything can be subjective to anyone.  It's lame that StackOverflow even makes that an issue.  One person might think something is subjective and unanswerable and another person might think a question is a great one.  Who cares.  As long as the poster is getting a benefit from the responses that's all that matters.\n\nPeople need to chill on stackoverflow and let people post their freakin questions without people wining (moderators and whistler blowers).\n\nIf someone is being rude that's one thing but to flag so many questions due to \"subjectivity\" is stupid because we may at times not know what we're looking for and the whole point to post subjective is to gain a lot of ideas, even conflictive viewpoints in order to consume that and take it for what it is in order to gain knowledge and learn."}, {"author_name": "Tshepang Lekhonkhobe", "gravatar_hash": "88e60659e997d36af3ff348b3251e1a6", "author_url": "http://tshepang.tumblr.com", "date": "Jan 05, 2011", "message": "@mgb That would only make sense if that load-balancer is developed by Canonical.
