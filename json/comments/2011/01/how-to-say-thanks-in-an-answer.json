If you push them not to do it, you're pushing them not to use an intuitive feature of the page, and a big red button labelled \"Do not press\" is at best frustrating.\n\nSo I would suggest the addition of an answer category, that could be \"Answer\" or \"Thanks\", with if possible an auto detection on 15 chars lenght answers containing the word \"Thank\". Don't give points of any kind on \"Thanks\" answer, don't compute any stats on them, and let them at the very bottom of the page.\n\nHaving put in place stackoverflow yourself proove your more advanced than I am in power users software, but I strongly fealon that very point than blocking most thank you answer is impossible without frustrating casual users of your site.
