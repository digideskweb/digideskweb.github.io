Another huge factor is that given we have a very minimal configuration of IIS on that tier, adding Java and another server (software, Solr) would *immensely* complicate our setup and build/deployment process compare to what it is now.\n\nGiven our deployment setup, making search changes in C# is trivial.  Also, it allows us to control the result weight, threading, and monitor everything going on across all servers.\n\nManaging how 81 databases (currently, and growing!) are indexed, at what speed, interval, thread count\u2026all the while being able see what each is doing (for example: what\u2019s the latest Post/Answer it\u2019s up to?) is not something we can do *easier* with Solr.\n\nI don\u2019t not-recommend Solr, it\u2019s a great search platform \u2013 I *absolutely* recommend it\u2026it just doesn\u2019t fit *our* needs or setup better than using Lucene directly does."}, {"author_name": "JonH", "gravatar_hash": "fab2c5dd38161cb858b6cbdbfa6189a3", "author_url": null, "date": "Jan 28, 2011", "message": "Ok that was a silly question I found it on the search page:\n\nIf that's not specific enough, you can narrow your search even further:\n\n\u2022to specific tags \n[tag] apples oranges\n[tag] [another-tag] apples oranges\n\nAlso to answer someone else's question I think it still is a OR rather then an AND in search.
