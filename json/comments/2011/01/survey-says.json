It's very interesting.\n\nThe lack of Blackberry users is not surprising. I think that Blackberries have been seeing a decline recently and since StackOverflow users are likely to be early adopters they will switch faster than most. Also, Blackberries are more common among Enterprise users and these demographics show that StaverOverflow users tend to work for smaller companies.\n\nWhich StackExchange sites were covered by this survey? Will there be surveys of the non-programming related sites?\n\nIt'd also be cool to have data associated with user profiles.
