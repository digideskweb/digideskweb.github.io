I agree that editing is important to prevent answers from becoming obsolete. The goal of creating canonical answers to everything is laudable.\n\nOne issue with editing old questions and answers is that they are basically dead. They receive no attention from the answerer community. True, people find them in searches, but when a question is first asked there is a buzz of activity around it. People are correcting answers, asking clarifying questions in the comments, etc. There should be a way of rejuvenating a question. All the old answerers should be notified to take a look at it again as it is now obsolete and needs more attention. It should show back up on the main page or something. I don't have a solution to this problem. Maybe questions can be marked as expired by a moderator and old answerers will get a message in their inbox to review their work?\n\nThere is no incentive (outside of altruism) to edit old questions. There should be more badges and reputation points awarded in this area.\n\nThere is only a short window of time to edit a question to make it more general. After that people answered it already and you can't fundamentally change a question after it has already been answered. The right thing to do is probably to answer the specific question and within the answer link to the general one. If there is no general form of the question you should create one and answer it.

SO is often used by those looking for quick answers and when they don't find those in the first three results of a search, they will create a new, often poorly worded, version.\n\nBut, on the other hand, often, someone will ask a question and not even realize that the answer exists, but using different keywords.  Looking at the SO Meta example <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/9686/what-is-the-most-rampant-duplicate-on-stack-overflow\" rel=\"nofollow\">mentioned</a>, it is clear that the first two questions (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/112803/what-is-the-best-web-prototyping-tool and\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/952558/what-kinds-of-tools-do-you-use-for-conceptual-design-of-your-software) from the accepted answer are targeting the same data, but the questions phrased entirely differently *and* the applied keywords don't apply.  These two authors probably did not intend to create the difference, but a search for the terms of one would rarely yield the data from the other.\n\nSome of the searches don't return the best results either.  Search for str int python compare and the first three results don't have the word \"compare\" in them.  It isn't until the forth search result that you will find something which actually addresses the question at hand.\n\nMoreover, as a UI perspective, I think that there is a mistake in the placement of SO's \"search tips\".  It is also visually \"out of the way\" -- it is in a right column, an area generally relegated to menu bars and meta data which is generally \"unimportant\".  In Bing and Google \"advanced search\" is something which is fairly prominent in a search result display page.  Yahoo a little less so -- the user has to click options.  But access to advanced is still in prime real estate in all cases.\n\nAnother thing which SO might benefit from is the format which is used by the search engines.  Google will generally return four lines: Title, two line description, and then a short version of the URL.  It takes up about half as much space as the typical SO response.  This means that I can see twice as many results without any interaction beyond the initial search.\n\nWith <a href=\"http://www.iprospect.com/about/researchstudy_2008_blendedsearchresults.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">49% of the general public</a> unwilling to search beyond page 1 of search results (and developers are people too), there should be real concern over making those results appear bloated.  I know that a lot of the data presented is imporant (and I will always prefer to look at questions with positive votes), but there is a lot of extra in there as well. (Is user icon really relavent to a search?)\n\nPerhaps this is unfair.  I don't have to deal with laying out changes.  I certainly am not involved in the CSS which would be involved (though I think that this would largely be just that: CSS and nothing more).  But this is what the rest of the world does with searching.  Further, if searches cannot reliably return pages with all search terms in them (or at least cannot place them as the first result), maybe it would be worth considering."}, {"author_name": "BlueRaja", "gravatar_hash": "460167b95ff5a363d3977ddb56cfe074", "author_url": "http://www.blueraja.com/blog", "date": "Jan 05, 2011", "message": "\"Don\u2019t answer questions that have already been answered elsewhere.

I *always* search before I post, and I conscientiously read through at *least* the first page of results (though admittedly sometimes at speed and without attention to detail).

When a raw newbie there's a lot of pressure to up the rep count as quickly as possible in order to participate more meaningfully. The memory of being chastized and downvoted for adding a new answer to a question instead of a comment still stings a bit (I didn't have enough rep to comment). This means the strata of users which are most likely to ask dupes, newbies, is the same strata which is most likely to benefit from asking a dupe (a lot of dupes get an upvote or two before the dupe is noticed/discovered).

In this case, right answers can get more votes, but wrong is still selected and shows up first. By wrong I mean objectively non-optimal when others are objectively more optimal (we are programmers, after all). This can be because a neophyte asked and eagerly accepted the first answer, which was good enough, and are no longer participating and notice other answers. Or perhaps the question has been edited to become more general, duplicate (or near-duplicate) questions point here, and more general answers are submitted. Again, the original asker is not involved, and therefore the selected \"right\" answer does not get updated. How does the SE system handle this?\n\nThe second major problem is somewhat related and is: Staleness. Ask a general question, it is answered for OS X 10.5. A while later 10.6 comes out, the question is still valid, but the answer is now totally wrong, perhaps even dangerous on the new system. There is a preference for new questions to be active, gain votes, gain answers, etc. Hence the issue of staleness. I can edit the question to make it clear it was for a 10.5 system, edit the 'best' answer with 10s of votes to make it mention it is a 10.5 solution, add a 10.6 solution, but the 10.6 solution will just not gain much notice because the original question is a year old.\n\nPeople might google the Q, come across the A, read the 10.6 stuff as that is relevant, but not being part of the community, they'll just use the info and go on their way, not bothering to vote what is now the 'more correct' (as more people are now running 10.6 than 10.5) answer up. It is stale.\n\nAny thoughts on these two scenarios is much appreciated."}, {"author_name": "John Arbaugh", "gravatar_hash": "5c3a905a8010d1325c489aa26eee52c0", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 28, 2011", "message": "I think Eric Zhao is on the right track - search for their answer and present them with the results before they can actually submit.  \nAdditionally all the original questions and edited questions are a gold mine for making the system smarter about finding duplicates and directing anyone who does not know \"how\" to ask the question to the right answer. If I ask a question about \"x++, ++x\" and similar questions exist that are closed as duplicates then point me to the right answer about using increment operators anyway.
