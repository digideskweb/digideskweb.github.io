SEND CODEZ PLZ?\" doesn't get us, the Charybdis of \"UTFG n00b, we're too smart to help you\" will.\n\nThis \"general reference\" reminds me of the original \"close as duplicate\" implementation - frankly, I don't care if any specific question gets closed or stays open; the point is \"whatever happened, did that answer the question?\" - and \"LMGTFY\" doesn't do that. If closing as reference will allow to select something like this, it might help (different from \"duplicate\" in that there's a pre-selected \"reference\" question)."}, {"author_name": "Aarobot", "gravatar_hash": "687f8a43b58fe35c8b2933f1f16b13cb", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 23, 2011", "message": "I see a lot of comments here pouncing on the \"easy to Google\" or \"newbie question\" angle, and I would like to clarify something that I know Jeff has taken to heart but many of the commenters here aren't getting:\n\nWe are talking about answers addressed by GENERAL REFERENCE SOURCES.\n\nGENERAL REFERENCE.  Please, everybody, learn and understand what that means.\n\nGeneral reference means a dictionary, an atlas, an encyclopedia, etc.  Sources that are *universally* available and *extremely well-known*.  Not a blog, not a news article, not an academic journal.\n\nAs I noted in my comments on the Cooking site, people should consider Bloom's taxonomy here.  General reference sources are specially-crafted to be excellent at dissemination of Knowledge-level information.  That is the kind of question we are talking about closing.  It doesn't matter how *easy* the question is, it matters how *basic*.  There's a subtle but important difference.\n\nLook at the front page of Stack Overflow.  Virtually every single question there is at the *Application* level of the taxonomy. I understand the tools and syntax, and I understand what I'm trying to accomplish, but I can't quite figure out how to apply the former to the latter.  A lot of those questions may still seem very simple to experienced programmers, but even the yawn-fest of \"How do I write a LEFT JOIN in Linq\" questions are still challenging and interesting to *someone*, because they take *skill* to answer.\n\nAs we go further down the taxonomy, the questions become less and less interesting.  \"What language is this code written in?\"  or \"What's the difference between Linq to SQL and Entity Framework?\" or \"What does it mean when I get a NullReferenceException here?\" Comprehension questions like these are generally frowned upon, and thought of as prosaic, but are nevertheless tolerated.  You still need to ask a programmer to get the answer. Asking the library reference desk isn't going to get you there.\n\nBut the pure Knowledge questions - ooh, they make us furious, and we always seem to have a hard time articulating why.  \"List of X\" - that's knowledge.  \"Plz send the codes\" - that's knowledge.  \"How do you pronounce SQL?\" - knowledge.  Dry context-less facts, rote memorization.  Those are the Eternal September questions that bore us all to tears.  Anybody can answer them, even those with no programming skill whatsoever.  Many of us have been members of communities that eventually got flooded with these kinds of questions, and we left.  Descend from the mediocre Comprehension questions into the mind-numbing Knowledge questions and that is just too much for many of us to bear.  A glut of such questions it the death knell for any community of experts.\n\nElite communities like Math Overflow and (controversially) Theoretical CS want to deal with *Analysis* level questions or better - so-called \"research level\" questions.  We are *way* more open-minded on Stack Overflow and most of the other Stack Exchanges; we set the bar *much* lower; but we still have our limits.  When we say \"no question too basic\", we actually mean \"no specific programming question too basic\" - general knowledge questions are really in a different category altogether.\n\nThat doesn't mean every Knowledge question should be closed, incidentally; only those that have their own Wikipedia page or dictionary entry.\n\nStack Overflow/Stack Exchange's mission is ostensibly to make the internet a better place; by answering general-reference questions that already have *better* answers on Wikipedia, we're actually making it worse. Oh, sure, we're creating a negative experience for that one user who asked the question, but we are actually doing a favour to future visitors by directing them to an *authoritative* source of information, as opposed to what \"some guy on the internet\" says.\n\nSo I agree whole-heartedly with this idea, and hope that the (IMO very polite) close reason makes it into the repertoire.  I also definitely support attaching a URL to the close vote, like duplicates, because after all, this is essentially a very specialized case of duplication."}, {"author_name": "Pekka", "gravatar_hash": "100a6c42a31a56e882475725d65537f8", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 24, 2011", "message": "Case in point: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5103596/array-walk-array-map-situtaions"}, {"author_name": "Piskvor", "gravatar_hash": "3fc34e753d1f98a60b12db03bceaf7fe", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 24, 2011", "message": "@Pekka: That seems to be a textbook example of a \"help vampire\", down to dumping every single step of the problem at SO.
