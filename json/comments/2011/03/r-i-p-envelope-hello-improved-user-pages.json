But it has come far since, not least, I suspect, due to the many suggestions by those who were displeased with the original replacement. \n\nWhat's really, really sad about this, though, is the fact that I can only _suspect_ that being the case, because many of those discussions got wiped out in what I can't help but assume an attempt to quieten dissenting voices and erase all traces of errors being made. Some of these questions and answers are still available to the 0.2% of &gt;10k users on meta, but those parts of the discussions that took place in comments are completely wiped out. \n\nAs much as I would like to say I like the new GUI (and maybe I do), this gets drowned in a very bitter feeling about the way Jeff dealt with critique, which for me took out much of the joy of participating on SE (see http://stacksbi.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/sbi-is-leaving/). \n\nAnd I really wonder whether this reply will get published, and if so, for how long."}]}
