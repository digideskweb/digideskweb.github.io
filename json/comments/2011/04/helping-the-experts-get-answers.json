Getting a real person to follow through and try to address my tweet impressed me immensely.\n\nSeems like it would be very cool if there was an easy way post twitter questions to stackexchange.  One can imagine many ways to do it, but ideally it would allow the asker and/or their followers to post a tweet to stackexchange, reply to the original poster letting them know of the question, and allow them to sign up for twitter replies as new answers are posted.\n\nWould be a great service to the twitter community by making the sorts of interactions in your blog post happen more easily."}, {"author_name": "Hogan", "gravatar_hash": "face3276756bf64319a7d1df0d194d5c", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 05, 2011", "message": "@Jeff - Please consider marking more answers as excepted.  50% is not so good, you will get answers quicker if you improve this rate.
