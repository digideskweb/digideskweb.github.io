Two (now three) bits of feedback:\n\n- we should give meetups a budget based on size that we fund (USA only? dunno about international) where we reimburse say $100 for meetups of 30 people and $200 for meetups of 60 people. This should be enough to cover pizza and drinks.\n\n- we should have guidelines about printing out (or hand-writing) name tags that include your gravatar, your tags of interest, your rep, and user name.. basically, your \"user card\" as it appears on the site. This helps immensely when getting to know people\n\n- make sure they know to clearly mark the venue and/or the participants so people can find each other -- perhaps \"seed\" the organizers with a t-shirt and ask that they prominently wear it so others can find them (like @oscarreyes)\n\nI think those three simple changes would help a lot in the future."}, {"author_name": "JonH", "gravatar_hash": "fab2c5dd38161cb858b6cbdbfa6189a3", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 11, 2011", "message": "@Jeff Atwood - I think I've asked you this before, Are you serious?
