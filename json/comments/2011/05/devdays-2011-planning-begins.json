I am also confused about the DC location - I would imagine there is greater appeal to having it in Boston or NY.  Oh well.  \n\nThe nice thing about the first DevDays was the affordability.  The amount Joel mentioned is great for a conference, but now you're adding hotel, travel and meals as well as an additional day - all significant costs - both time and money.  Those lucky enough to be in the area of an event previously only had to come up with the $99 - which I thought was the whole point of DevDays - to have an affordable one day event.  \n\nDevDays just took a turn towards being yet another expensive, inaccessible conference.  What a shame.\n\nThis policy of two days and in fewer cities pushes the average cost (not including time) to $1000-$1500 or more.  \n\nI realize the crew is trying to cater to those that complained last time, but now what I thought was the original intent is lost."}, {"author_name": "Jeffrey", "gravatar_hash": "bc49feef07133ab11b996f4ed8505b9d", "author_url": null, "date": "May 04, 2011", "message": "@tim\n\nI'm not sure this is exactly being \"inaccessible\".
