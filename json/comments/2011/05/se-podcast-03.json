But they are a visible number, and are the most prominent part of the careers profiles, and people do care about it.\n\nI also understand the need for some mechanisms for stewardship and clean-up in the Stack Exchange ecosystem, so it doesn't devolve into a free-for-all.  This will include some policing, and incentives for people who do that work.\n\nMy problem is that the Stack Exchange system conflates the rewards for these activities.  \"Real\" society has police officers, firefighters, and garbage collectors, but these aren't usually the professions with the most prestige, and we don't (generally) reward these people based on how aggressive they are in carrying out these duties.\n\nThis is Wikipedia's problem -- that they in essence reward people for being assholes, so they get a lot of assholes.  Here, there's a potential real-world reward for being an asshole.\n\nI'm not sure I have a solution, but I think it would include separating the rewards for stewardship activities from the rewards for producing helpful content."}, {"author_name": "Pietro Polsinelli", "gravatar_hash": "5198744cd329b6dfdb9e39b4f9794cd1", "author_url": "http://http.//pietro.open-lab.com", "date": "May 08, 2011", "message": "For the city metaphor, Jeff observations made me think that you probably are metaphorically similar to a touristic town: like Florence town center has about 50.000 inhabitants but gets millions of visitors.

You typically start off at a decent enough volume when you begin a statement, and then you trail off into what comes off as a whisper.

I wonder if on an upcoming show you could talk about the possibility of extending StackExchange to a online trainer platform, i.e. giving users the tools to easily organize selected answers into lessons, and giving them the ability to more easily create structured tutorials and embed video and audio in a way that, e.g. if I want to teach a course on C#, I could easily select from the vast content of good C# questions/answers on Stackoverflow as 50-80% of the content of a course and then use available tools to build a complete course around it. Others could find the course and work through it online, or other trainers could use the course material to teach the course onsite, or use tools you provide to easily add or subtract content. It would be a good way to repurpose your content and, as you say, make the Internet a better place, in this case: to take online courses on C#, baking a good cake, or learning English grammar, etc. Other companies are attempting this (e.g. www.sophia.org) but they unfortunately suffer from a lack of participants and lack of a mature reputation system that StackExchange already has, and hence these attempts easily degrade into quagmires of low-quality content and get abandoned. StackExchange, on the other hand, already has large amounts of content ready to be turned into high-quality online courses if you would just provide trainers with the right tools to do it."}, {"author_name": "Sudipta Sarkar", "gravatar_hash": "9c8f41cbf471c978f0ec67005dc874b8", "author_url": "http://www.buybooksonline24x7.com", "date": "May 14, 2011", "message": "Books are your best friends, for they give you the access to the knowledge-land.
