A comment about the topic concerning chat.  I think you guys did a fabulous job of implementing it.  It's fast, nicely designed, and works well.  But I'll be quite honest, that effort to me seems to be wasted.  Rarely if ever do people use it...the few times I've used it either no one was talking, or everyone was simply idle.  No offense as I said, I think the implementation was done great..but it suffers from any other chat client.  I mean come on who uses AIM, Yahoo Chat, or any of that stuff anyhow.  You can argue Skype, however I think skype's success is due to telephone / communication via the web with web cam technology.  I just don't see a lot of value in stackoverflow or any stack exchange site using chat.\n\nI would of also liked to hear more from Marc G.

I don't know C#, but looking in from the outside I see that the maintainers tend to add new language features on a regular basis. An overview of the language, starting with the syntax for version 1 and building up to version 5 would be of interest to me.\n\nSince this is a language some in the audience are likely to know in depth and some won't know (or care about) at all, I realize such a talk would be difficult to construct. The evolution of the language lends it to all kinds of metaphors; building up some sort of Heath Robinson/Rube Goldberg program; using the syntax to do cool stuff; hopefully some combination of these would be enough to keep everyone entertained."}, {"author_name": "Ninefingers", "gravatar_hash": "893b695548c4c8a5fcf91edb92785490", "author_url": null, "date": "May 13, 2011", "message": "I listened to the podcast for the first time - a good listen. \n\nOn accept rate, I suggested this a while ago on meta (I called it citizenship and compared it to Windows's system rating): http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/80312/why-are-votes-per-post-on-the-decrease-what-can-we-do-to-improve-this/80626#80626 The first half of the post is slightly worthless I think; the second half is sort of what you're suggesting. Note, the actual implementation of it would probably benefit from this: http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html i.e. **crucially** weight people's score based on the amount of information receive. So persistently bad users' scores degrade the more they abuse the system, whereas people who contribute get better scores. Weight it across valid flags, edits, votes, answers etc and accept rate.\n\nSecond thing, you mentioned languages. As someone who did a module in French at university, I've got some experience with translation. The example I'd like to point out is the phrase \"to get\" in English. There is no equivalent in French - to get on a bus = prendre le bus (to take the bus), to get up = se lever (literally to raise oneself), to get a present = could be anything, j'ai ach\u00eat\u00e9 un cadeau (I brought a present) ou J'ai re\u00e7oit un cadeau (I received a present). It depends entirely on context.\n\nWhat you see in the dictionary, therefore, for `to get` is a huge list of possible scenarios. You have to search through and find the one you're after. So it may be that a non-native speaker has not done this when translating an idea from Unicorn to English, for example, where the concept in Unicorn has no direct equivalent or several possible equivalents in English. That's the why.\n\nAlso, whilst google translate is improving, it isn't perfect and never will be. Therefore, perhaps users are using that (or equivalent) to check their posts.\n\nOn the subject of translation, I've been keeping this reasonably quiet, but: http://stackapps.com/questions/2392/stack-overflow-ui-translation-via-greasemonkey is a translation effort of the UI by yours truly. I took your html apart with firebug and am using greasemonkey/jquery to literally replace English strings on the UI with French ones. It isn't finished, it's still a bit buggy and I'm not a native French speaker so some translations may be off (I did it last weekend at about this hour) but I thought it might provide a template for some initial crowdsourced translations...\n\nNinefingers"}, {"author_name": "Rupert", "gravatar_hash": "a923d42ccf0b28810552f10d950faa13", "author_url": null, "date": "May 17, 2011", "message": "The stackoverflow faq describes the site as a sort of mashup between, amongst other things, a forum and a wiki. The attitude towards \"good questions\" expressed on this podcast worries me slightly as it seems to have been inherited from the forum side of this ancestry. \n\nForums have systemic problems when it comes to answering questions but these are often portrayed as faults with the users. One mentioned in this cast is that it is unfair if the questioner has put less effort into the question than the answerer puts into the answer. As a result gaps can appear in the collective knowledge as questions lacking this quality are rejected.\n\nWikis do not have this problem. Knowledge is treated as an item to be shared, its expression to be refined as much as possible. The questioner, in the case of Wikipedia, is the reader of a given page and is not expected to have put in any effort. Yet despite this, a wealth of knowledge is still developed.\n\nI believe poorly worded questions should be seen as an opportunity to ask better questions by utilising the wiki feature on stackoverflow. Judgements made about fairness, whilst accurate, lack utility and encourage people to actively ignore these opportunities."}, {"author_name": "Bill P.

I appreciate in your annoying Ned Flanders way you want to help everyone, but answering those questions is a waste of people's time and I don't care about my rep, but I do care about wasting my time trying to help someone who doesn't even care that they're being helped.\n\nSo I don't try and be rude to users with low accept rates, but I will comment on it. If people think that's wrong (and Jeff and Joel didn't disagree with Jon as far as I could tell), then accept rate should be removed from the site. It's absolutely pointless to show a stat and then expect people not to act on it."}]}
