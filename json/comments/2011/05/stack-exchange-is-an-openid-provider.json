There are some gnarly &lt;iframe&gt; hacks we pull to make it seem like you never leave the site, but everything about identity is stored off-site just like, say, GMail. I am very leery of us becoming another MyOpenID, that is, allowing sites to outsource their entire login and signup process to openid.stackexchange.com, but it IS possible. Nobody else can pull the same tight integration with login, signup, password recovery, and log out that we can currently; but there's no reason we can't open that up down the line at least in potentiality. It is possible to produce an outstanding third-party login and account creation system and <i>we can prove it because we do it</i>.\n\n2) <b>We aren't guaranteeing that our credentials will work on <i>every</i> site that accepts OpenID.</b>  There are loads of crummy libraries out there.  However, any reasonably large site that attempts discovery (XRDS-style) that can be proven to work with a few well behaving providers and does not accept our provider should definitely be reported on http://meta.stackoverflow.com."}, {"author_name": "Kev", "gravatar_hash": "6bfb56d99a26f5f97cd4822fba0364fb", "author_url": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/419/kev", "date": "May 27, 2011", "message": "Nice one Jeff, you guys are all growed up. :)"}, {"author_name": "Benny", "gravatar_hash": "ee98cccb68318cf0ec167c05fd3ace7e", "author_url": null, "date": "May 27, 2011", "message": "Well done Jeff!

The blogger redirect keeps giving a 404 error. Looks to me like it is an issue with blogger's implementation, but it was working a little while ago.
