You want to produce pearls; with that I agree.  But you *don't* optimise for pearls: they are the result of the process.  You optimise for *high quality sand*.\n\nThe incentives are all wrong.  As a questioner, I don't give a fig about reputation, nor about the ability to ask questions at some later date.  All I care about is getting an answer to the question that I have *right now*.  I don't care if I have to set up a proxy to get round a blocked IP (I could just switch my wireless off and on again to get a new one!), all I care about is *getting an answer*.  So long as I can actually ask it, that's all I care about.  Of course, if I phrase it well then I optimise my chance of getting an answer, but with the size of the user base then there's always a good chance that someone will come by looking to pluck low-hanging fruit and I'll get my answer.\n\nSo that's the problem you have to fix: remove all incentives for *answers* to bad questions.  If a question is bad, an answerer should get *no reputation* from it.  Then the only incentive for answering is the one to help someone out, and as an answerer I know that I'd rather help someone who shows some investment in the question.  Then as a questioner, if I see all these other questions getting answers but mine doesn't, I have all the incentives I need to figure out how to make my question better to attract answers.  They beauty of this is that it makes it the questioners job to make the questions better, not your job to keep bad questions out.\n\nIt may be a bit complicated, but if you really want to produce pearls, then you need to optimise for sand.  But good sand.  Here's some ideas (not fully thought through: but that's *your* job!):\n\n1. An answer does not, in general, accrue reputation until the question has more than N votes (where N is 1 more than the \"typical sympathy\" vote level).\n\n2. If the answerer does not vote for the question, they get no reputation for it!  But answerers' votes should not count in the computation above.\n\n3. A *really good* answer can accrue reputation on a bad question, but only once it reaches a certain threshold (again, probably site-specific).  Thus if you are going to answer a bad question, you'd better be sure that you give a really good answer.\n\n3. The reputation for the answer could scale with the votes on the question (maybe, depends on whether \"good\" questions and \"popular\" questions are reasonably aligned for the site in question).\n\n4. Votes on a question should give reputation in a similar fashion: they don't give reputation until an answer with enough votes has been supplied.  In this case, I wouldn't have votes giving reputation at all until an answer has been given, even if the question gets 100 votes.\n\nThe idea is that the votes on a question give an indication of the *potential reward* for answering it.  They say, \"This many people are interested in finding out the answer to this question\" (or perhaps: \"This many people think that this question is worth answering\": how many people vote for a question and then never go back to see if it has been answered?).  So to an answerer, it helps focus their attention and it backs-up that focus with an appropriate reward: \"Answer *this* question and you get a warm glow of having helped one person.  But no reputation.  Answer *that* question and you get a warm glow of having helped lots of people.  And a whole hunk of reputation in to the bargain.\".\n\nI'll say it again: Don't optimise for pearls.  You'll kill the golden goose.  Figure out what kind of food your goose likes and then feed it with that!\n\n(With extreme apologies for mixing my fairy tales.)"}, {"author_name": "Andrew Stacey", "gravatar_hash": "c9359d5d299cd6f7b0bf8cc123c69234", "author_url": "http://www.math.ntnu.no/~stacey/CountingOnMyFingers", "date": "Jun 14, 2011", "message": "Just to point out one more thing.

Fine, and definitely the poster should be looking at them when referred and closing or deleting their own question if the others have answered their current/new post.  \n\nSo on the other hand, in some cases (many) the poster goes and takes a look at these duplicates that people are bitching about.  But if the poster feels that the answers given in other user's post(s) is not adequate then the poster shouldn't have to put up with people trying to close his/her question just because people take out the \"it's already been asked\" flag.\n\nThe point is, sometimes there are reasons people re-post a question that may have been answered even in 3-5 other threads.\n\nWhy would one possibly repost a question that's already been posted?  Possible reasons:\n\n\n1) Other posts that were researched did not answer their question, therefore they know they are posting it again but they try to do it in a different light or hope that this time around there comes a better set of answers.  Some people know they have a better way to ask a question than previous posters and know they can get a better response in these cases as the other previous posts by other users out there have not helped after review.\n\n2) Everyone learns differently.  And everyone explains things differently.  Some people just suck at explaining things.  They are poor communicators and even sometimes asses.  So the point here is just because \"the question has been answered\" in x post, doesn't mean that the answers (regardless of the fact that the answer was liked by many) are sufficient for someone because they still may not understand it.  So they are posting it again so they can mold their own communication style in possibly a new context and might have a better way at getting better responses than that \"other\" post\n\n\n3) Just because I post something similar to another, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m asking for necessarily the same info. I may be asking for the same and MORE as stated in the post detail. There are often times I see people closing posts just because the title is the same but they don\u2019t even look at the content of the post which might have a variation to the same topic. They think it sounds the same and try to force the poster to close it but they really don\u2019t read. And they don\u2019t think about the context or new problem that the poster who appears to be duping is bringing up which the enitire intent may be different even though it\u2019s the same question being asked (plus possibly a twist to the previously answered questions).\n\nNow take that and collectively yea, you have a bunch of \"duplicate posts\".  But that's really kinda of a narrow minded attitude toward this.  Because collectively those 5-10 posts on the similar topic ends up with 50-100 replies that collectively has a wealth of information about that issue, and has 50-100 ways of it being communicated which would mean that in one of those posts, it's going to help this person or that person depending on their learning style.\n\nSo I totally disagree that having duplicate posts are a downfall of forum quality.  I agree that we should definitely first off be pointing people to posts already made.  Because half the time they will answer the question and thus the poster can just delete his dup.  But that's not always the case...not at all.\n\nThe human aspect needs to be in this equation.  It shouldn't be a clear cut flag.  There are benefits that people have not even considered it looks like here where duplicate posts are not 100% horrible in any forum.\n\n\nNot all problems are the same 100%. It\u2019s assumed that if one question was answered already that surely it will resolve any future question whatsoever on that topic or error or whatever you have\u2026but that is not how code is. Code is not black and white. And questions and answers shouldn\u2019t be expected to be black and white. Variations of the same question should be allowed and accepted by the community here trying to help someone understand or assist in a real problem or learning blockage.\n"}, {"author_name": "Eric", "gravatar_hash": "4e99da570c58f9d0b99d64df07cba078", "author_url": null, "date": "Jan 24, 2012", "message": "http://ithavoc.wordpress.com/2009/08/31/stackoverflow-com-sucks-take-1/\n\nthe point is, our craft is not always black and white.
