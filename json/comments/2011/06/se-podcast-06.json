We found that too many people weren\u2019t willing to down vote questions because of the -1 cost to the voter. Downvotes on questions are a critically important signal for us in separating the good questions from the not-so-good questions\"\n\nMy answer to that is they should of NEVER cost me anything, and for that matter, why are downvote answers -1 to the person making the downvote?  It is an opinion and should not be a charge and a slap in the wrist.  Shouldn't the whole point of the system be a good q&amp;a site that really doesn't run on a +/- rep voting scheme.  I am not saying get rid of voting, what I am saying is make it fair.

I've seen questions get closed that had several answers already, etc. etc. \n\nI'm almost certainly oversensitive about this, but honestly if I could just somehow never see a closed question again, I'd be much better off, and could stop equating Stack Exchange with the Wikipedia modmins."}]}
