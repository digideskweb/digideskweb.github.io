They're basically just a summary of the entire conversation; while that's good for searching, it's not very useful for a listener to read to accompany the show.\n\nAnd where are the links?

If I might make one suggestion, work on finding a solution to the problem of Jeff having no on-screen presence (well, excluding the monitor in the far back of the room). It's very odd watching two people discuss a topic, and then a third voice speaks up and engages the two on-screen faces.

Lively debate about computing topics by people with various backgrounds is what I missed during the hiatus.
