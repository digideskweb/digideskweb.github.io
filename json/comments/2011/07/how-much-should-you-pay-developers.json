With the growth of e-commerce I sincerely feel like the developer's role has evolved from a backroom geek to a revenue generating super star.  Really.  How significant is it for Amazon, Ebay and some gaming sites to have the right programmers?  Just as significant to have the right sales people who bring in business.  Except in this case, the programmers help keep your business.  Why not pay them commissions?  Only one major issue.  Neither employers nor programmer employees are accustomed to being paid on this scale.  This means risk vs reward.  So a senior programmer in the LA area who might be worth say $120k should have the option to be paid $60k-$75k base + % of the gross profits of the game he/she helped develop.  The risk is that you wont make it past $85k for a poor performing website.  The reward is that if you happen to work for a great company then you might make $200k+.  The employer doesn't lose because he gets top talent at a low starting base pay and only pays out when he himself is making enough money to justify it.  :)"}, {"author_name": "JonH", "gravatar_hash": "fab2c5dd38161cb858b6cbdbfa6189a3", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 19, 2011", "message": "@Joshua Lee,\nI'd like to work for you.
