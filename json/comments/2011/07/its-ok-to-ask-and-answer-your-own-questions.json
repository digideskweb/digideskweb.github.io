Then you can include it and state so.\n\nBut preferable to that, you should make sure you wait long enough, say a few weeks or even a month, for someone else to come up with the same answer you discovered. Then you can and should give them credit for the answer. And you can document any subtleties in comments to that answer or by editing your question with a followup.\n\nAnd waiting the few weeks or month without accepting an answer will result in more answers, giving you more ideas, and maybe a better solution.\n\nI see now that Stack Exchange is not only allowing answering your own question. They're actually promoting it! \n\nClick \"Ask Question\" and on the page just below the \"Post Your Question\" button, you'll see a line that says:\n\n\"Answer your own question \u2013 share your knowledge, Q&amp;A-style\"\n\nAt the beginning of the line is a checkmark.

I have googled so much that my fingers cramped up so i'm just gonnna go ahead and ask it here. \n\nPlatform: PC  (commonly played with Joystick) \nYear: Somewhere between 1992 and 1999\n\nMain Character description: its a guy that has this black clothing, it looks like some spandex suit or w.e or a leather suit idk its all black and it doesnt show pants or shirt it looks like a one piece clothing. It's alll black. He has this pointy head or hat or w.e. The gun he has looks weird too it kind of reminds me of a candy shovel. You know those things u use to scoop candy in a candy store.\n\nGame description: The environment is aswell inside as it is outside. You have to fight ennemies. I cant remember the small ones but i do remember you having to shoot some weird looking tanks and robot ish vehichles. Also eventually jets or planes or maybe even space ships cant really remember. Also you could collect \"Apples\" and \"Presents\" and also \"candy\" if im not mistaking. Now people who have played this game and know the title know which game im talking about by now. And to be honest i dont really have any more additional info. I reaaaaaallllyy hope someone can help me out. Because i ve been searching for the title of this game for the past 6 years or so. The OS it was played on is windows 95 or 98.\n\nGreetings and i really hope someone can help me and much much thanks in advance, Xander"}]}
