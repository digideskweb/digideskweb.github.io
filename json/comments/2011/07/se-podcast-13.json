Her idea is that if you make things particularly ugly, (think red and blinking messages) then you can be sure that a designer with actually examine it and come up with a good design, instead of glossing over it because it's just good enough to not need to be addressed."}, {"author_name": "JonH", "gravatar_hash": "fab2c5dd38161cb858b6cbdbfa6189a3", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 28, 2011", "message": "+1 to Jin, I think the 21st century is more about web development then graphic designer.  Graphic designers need to play a bigger role based on web 2.0, meaning graphics doesn't cut it anymore.  I think Jin has done an excellent job on all the sites and I particularly find the mobile app that him and montrose developed to be very nice, lean, and clean.  Kudos Jin you earned it."}, {"author_name": "Stephen Hart", "gravatar_hash": "803700d3d6549deff1353ac574fc1beb", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 03, 2011", "message": "The Robin Williams that wrote the Non-Designers book is actually a woman.
