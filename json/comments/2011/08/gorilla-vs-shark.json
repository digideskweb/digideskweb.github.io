The advice given is also only as good as the other factors taken into consideration. In the choice of language this would be: What will you be using it to do? What sort of job do you have or are you looking to get? What sort of salary do you want? etc etc. We could extend this to someone saying should I become a Doctor or a Lawyer. No doubt people would argue for both but does that make one wrong or right? If someone becomes a Lawyer on the basis of this advice and regrets it does that make the advice wrong? Does that mean no-one should ever ask that question or ask existing Lawyers and Doctors what their job is like? Obviously not and so these questions will always be asked.
