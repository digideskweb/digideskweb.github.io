The anecdote I can add to this story is that BY FAR the most striking element of the job listing was that it referenced the Joel Test, listing out which checkboxes the company checked (11/12, as it happens).

But if the site gets too many 'telecommute' ads that turn out to allow telecommuting only once a week or have other restrictions, that diminishes the value of this cue, first for potential applicants, ultimately for all.\n\nAnd there is a big difference between regionally restricted part-time telecommuting vs. full-time  \"work from anywhere\" positions. It would be great, if one could search for the latter without having to browse through pages of 'telecommute in Reykjav\u00edk region' (or 'telecommute, bay area home required') ads."}, {"author_name": "Korneel Bouman", "gravatar_hash": "2c3f79bed945b193634cf6794df49661", "author_url": "http://careers.stackoverflow.com", "date": "Aug 04, 2011", "message": "@Joerg Agreed, we've just put extra guidance in place to ensure the telecommute option is only selected for true \"work from anywhere\" jobs."}, {"author_name": "Jens Roland", "gravatar_hash": "eafc9ff73a64e9d0d6f949c77d6135b7", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 09, 2011", "message": "The site TopProspect does something interesting with job listings: they let employers offer rewards for people who refer the right candidate.

Traditional media (Newspaper, Craigslist, Dice) completely failed at producing me qualified applicants. For both of the developers I hired they came through my SO careers job posting.\n\nI also appreciate that you don't behave like Dice which is to guard the description and title like a hen house from a fox. In the first 15 days I was able to locate my senior developer, and in the last 15 days I was able to locate my mid-level developer through the same job posting with SO. The treatment I received from this has shown me for all future hiring I will start on SO first, and then consider other media ONLY if I don't get hires directly."}, {"author_name": "Erika", "gravatar_hash": "91877569582166f197294b183e025852", "author_url": "http://www.kik.com", "date": "Dec 12, 2011", "message": "TL;DR is spot on.
