There are, occasionally, questions where there it is clear from the outset that the answerer and the answer should not be linked so closely as in a usual answer.  These are cases where the answer does not take any particular effort by the answerer and where the answerer should take neither the credit nor the blame for the answer.\n\nAn obvious such is a question such as \"What is the best book for a beginner learning LaTeX?\".  It's a reasonable question (not fantastic, but okay) but the most likely answers are just a list of books, maybe with a very short \"I like this because it's short.\".  The voting on such a question would help someone see which books are considered the best, and this isn't really related to the person who listed the book.  So the votes on an answer shouldn't really be reflected in the answerer's reputation.\n\nOf course, such questions shouldn't be the norm, and making it harder to make questions CW discourages them, which is a good thing.  But they can also be a useful way of drawing people in to the site.\n\nIn this particular case, it's easy to say that each person answering should just make their answer CW, but that involves a concious act by the answerer and they might not be aware of what that means (being more focussed on the *editing* than the *voting*).  Making the question CW is a simple way of ensuring that all the answers are CW.\n\nSo whilst I agree with the general principle that CW has been misused, it's not completely useless.

A vote represents both the interest of the users in knowing the answer and awarding the OP for asking the question.\n\nSo we make the question CW and the OP does not gain reputation. Now the problem is that it also forces the answers to be CW also, but why? An answer to such a question may justly deserve the reputation from votes, it can be a very high quality answer which needed high levels of knowledge and effort. I think it should be possible to make a question CW without forcing its answers to be CW also. It should not be difficult to implement this and this will be a handy possibility for moderators to make a question CW without making the answer CW also."}, {"author_name": "MatthewRyanRead", "gravatar_hash": "9f45abdea17c709041812609c7fdfb69", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 20, 2011", "message": "Great post, Grace.\n \n@Andrew, I disagree.

One has to wonder if you stopped reading after the 3rd line.\n\n\"What is the best book for a beginner learning LaTeX?\" is exactly the kind of question you *don't* want littering your site:\n\n1. It has no inherent value to the internet because Joe Average can find far better quality results on Amazon.\n\n2. It has negative value to the community because instead of attracting experts and enthusiasts, it will drive the majority of them away.\n\n3. The criteria are not even close to being specific; there are hundreds of such books and all of the answers and votes amount to nothing more than personal preference. No genuine indication of the quality of the answer OR the book itself.\n\n4. Because beginners invariably outnumber experts, the question will soon start to eclipse all others in votes and become one of the highest on the site, and then continue to get bumped to the front page over and over and over again.\n\n5. Once that happens, it just sits there, becoming more and more obsolete over time, yet inviting others to post similar questions and perpetuating the myth of community wiki as a Get Out Of Jail Free card, while moderators and experienced users futilely try to explain that yes, that *used* to be considered an acceptable question, but not *anymore*, so we're keeping it around for *historical* purposes, but please don't *copy* it, and nobody listens and nobody cares, and your best contributors start leaving in disgust because the crap just keeps coming.\n\nPlease, get it through your head: If your answer to \"Why should this be Community Wiki?\" includes the word \"reputation\" anywhere, you're doing it wrong."}, {"author_name": "Grace Note", "gravatar_hash": "b487224adf8dfd030f683530eb201ca7", "author_url": "http://gaming.stackexchange.com", "date": "Aug 20, 2011", "message": "Andrew Stacey, that's both an example of something that works, and something that could be improved. In this case, it is the answers which would need improvement - you could stay with just one-line answers, or you could encourage users to actually provide greater information than just the link to the book. Explain why it is useful to those learning the system, and even comparisons to other books - you can go a long way towards improving such answers beyond their one-line nature, and that removes the concern about reputation. Remember that the important thing is the votes, not the reputation.\n\nNevertheless, it's understood that sometimes, community wiki is something to be used. It's a specialty tool, not something to be universally avoided or loathed. As long as it isn't a prevalent presence on your site, it's fine to have a handful of questions which end up as community wiki. However, now that all the contributions to such *are* community wiki, why not take advantage of that, and improve what answers you do get?

More seriously, your reply seems far more like a \"This question would be off-topic on  and so therefore must be off-topic for TeX-SX.\" than a reasoned argument.  Based on the assumption that it is off-topic, you proceed with your argument.  Since I disagree with that assumption, it is pointless to dispute the points.  I've checked your account and you don't appear on TeX-SX, so how do you know what is on-topic or off-topic there?\n\nSetting that aside, your argument should have started with the assumption that this question was on-topic and *then* showed why my primary assertion (that there is still a situation where CW may be useful) was wrong.  As you attacked my example question (which I admitted wasn't a great question), and not my actual point, your list is irrelevant.\n\nGrace: Thanks.  I completely agree with your comment.  That's what I felt was missing from the actual post and hence why I commented.  Community wikis are often in need of more housekeeping than other posts, but that doesn't make them necessarily bad.  Indeed, it could make them great.  I was just looking at another of our CW questions and thinking, \"This is a mess, it needs cleaning up.\".  But the cleaning up is actually quite easy as it is simply a matter of organising the material.  No-one has to generate it for themselves.  One line answers can be a good way of quickly getting the information needed to make a single good summary post.\n\nIndeed, I'd say that that's the best use of a CW question-and-answer: when the spirit is far more \"let's get together, pool our knowledge, and write an article on X\" then \"Can someone answer my question?\".  Most often, the best CW questions are those with a *single* answer which summarises something.  But often the \"one line answers\" are what's needed to gather the information to make that post in the first place.\n\n(I see I've gotten a mathematical reCaptcha.
