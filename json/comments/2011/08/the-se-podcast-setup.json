It's used when the input is coming from someone remote (via phone, Skype, ISDN, whatever). If you've ever had a phone call where you could hear yourself back about half a second after you speak, you'll understand why that's so distracting.  \n\nThe tough part in this case is that they need to generate multiple mix-minuses.  As a result, they basically need to take each input discretely and create multiple mixes in software (or have a mixing board with a ton of mix busses)."}, {"author_name": "colin", "gravatar_hash": "7c5686ad6187300e94ac1da5c5765d5a", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 17, 2011", "message": "Justin, a mix minus feed is everything but your own audio, just because people get disconcerted when they hear themselves back from the remote end, especially if there is a time lag."}, {"author_name": "Justin", "gravatar_hash": "fa8cd7ca9f44b29511490e5ad8013cad", "author_url": "http://recordingquestions.com", "date": "Aug 17, 2011", "message": "You guys really need to properly post-process your podcasts audio with compression and limiting.

I'm sure there's a good reason for selecting the components you did, and I'm curious about the reasons.\n\nMy primary shock came when pricing out the mixer - $2400 for the 01v96 and another $420 for the MY8-DA96. Since you mentioned that you would have at most six participants (2-3 in studio, 2-3 remote) why not get the Mackie Onyx 1640i with 6 aux sends for $1500? It has Firewire, too, removing the need to use a Focusrite to get the audio into the recording computer, saving another $300.\n\nI will admit, I don't fully understand the reason for some of the equipment.
