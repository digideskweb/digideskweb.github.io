Tl;dr: DevDays and tons of other conferences are quite workable under a different model.\n\nThere's a large number of experienced conference runners and planners who will disagree, and collectively have been running inexpensive but good conferences for DECADES.\n\nThey're called \"SMOFs.\" They run science fiction conventions. (Not \"Star Trek\" conventions but \"science fiction\" conventions - books.) And the conventions are not for profit membership organizations typically with hundreds or thousands of members attending over a weekend at a cost of a few tens of dollars each.\n\nThe SMOFs are generally willing to help others run conferences by giving them advice, doing (paid) consulting work, or even fully (paid) managing conferences. A great example is Expotech, who ran MacHack.\n\n\nOh yeah, and if you're paying speakers, You're Doing It Wrong. The speakers should be drawn from the attendees/members.\n\nIf a speaker is a \"guest of honor\" (say a major keynote) you should comp them their conference membership, and possibly cover their hotel room and travel (which you'd arrange). That's it.\n\nNo paid speakers. No \"sponsors,\" either. Just members. Hundreds of conventions with a great many thousands upon thousands (potentially millions) of members make this work every year in sci-fi and the areas that have branched off from it like anime and comics."}, {"author_name": "Marco Ceppi", "gravatar_hash": "c127c8150f8052e4b89d66f42b99be56", "author_url": "http://marcoceppi.com", "date": "Sep 07, 2011", "message": "The speakers weren't paid."}, {"author_name": "Kyralessa", "gravatar_hash": "750159e9cdab58c4b6547d382311c9af", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 07, 2011", "message": "Have you considered, instead, sponsoring existing conferences?
