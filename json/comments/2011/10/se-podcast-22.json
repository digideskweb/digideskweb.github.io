It's not that ivory tower academics (necessarily) design languages that are unsuitable - it's that there are two requirements for a successful language.\n\n1, It has to be familiar (ie look like 'c') - so Java, C#, Python all caught on but lisp didn't. I don't know why Perl managed - probably because it was used by non-programmers!\n\n2, It has to have supporting libraries to actually do some work. The most perfectly language is useless if you can't talk to the screen/network/database/printer etc. So only languages that can use existing 'c' libs have caught on. \nBut it is why the web has been so fertile for new languages - if all you have to do is output html then you don't need much infrastructure.  Perhaps .Net will become a great place to try new stuff (like f#) ?"}, {"author_name": "Alexander", "gravatar_hash": "51a1a1af759c9075f2dd2bdac618cfed", "author_url": "http://www.superoferte.org/", "date": "Oct 14, 2011", "message": "THANK YOU!!!

As a mainly PHP developer who started with Pascal and Delphi back in the day (and is itching to delve into something new!), I can confirm many of the criticisms you guys make - especially dynamic typing, and the fact that most people using it don't have a programming background. It's not a good language to start programming with, for sure. Still, it does have its uses in the hands of a disciplined developer; starting with PHP 5, it is possible to create really good OO code in it; and there is no better way to deploy apps quickly, and dirt cheap in terms of hosting and supports. I agree it's not a greatly designed language in many respects, but a lot of what the web is today is built on it there's no need to hold your nose too high.\n\nWhat is really sad, though, is the lack of quality learning resources for the language, and the amount of crap code people come up with every day on SO is depressing. But if PHP weren't the choice of those coming from design, learning HTML and then PHP as their first experience, it would be some other language... \n\nAnyway, a very interesting and entertaining conversation!"}, {"author_name": "Joe Fitzsimons", "gravatar_hash": "e0aa5c01fbd1313fbd1bf7dd48526ea7", "author_url": "http://blog.jfitzsimons.org", "date": "Oct 18, 2011", "message": "@Christopher: Rather hilariously when I click through the link to your defense of PHP, right at the top of the page there is a PHP warning from your wordpress stats plugin."}, {"author_name": "Jake McGraw", "gravatar_hash": "033f3c1767386d93b1f17010205e7091", "author_url": "http://jakemcgraw.com", "date": "Oct 18, 2011", "message": "I had this long hyperbole about tools vs products, but you know what? @Chrisopher Allen-Poole nailed it in http://www.allen-poole.com/wordpress/2011/10/dont-be-hatin-a-defense-of-php/\n\nComplain all you want, all of us banging out fugly PHP will keep doing it because we enjoy building things, and not waxing poetic language features.

In most cases it would not work, so either language would change or people wouldn&#039;t use it.
