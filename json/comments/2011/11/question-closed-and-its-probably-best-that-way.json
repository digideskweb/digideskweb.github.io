My gut feeling is that this is a problem, because these are essentially shopping questions and as you say, there are potentially millions of them. I'd much rather see some generic \"how to find travel information and routes in x country\" type questions. But the travel community seems to disagree with me, so this can be a special case.</p>\n"}, {"author_name": "Joel Spolsky", "gravatar_hash": "d1129adecd8c4e2a22b50605d18e376d", "author_url": "http://joelonsoftware.com", "date": "Dec 07, 2011", "message": "<p>You see, if the rule is \"only real questions,\" then you won't get a million bogus questions -- you'll get things where there really is a hole in the internet.
