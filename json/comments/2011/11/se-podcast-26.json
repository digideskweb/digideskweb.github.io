If someone learns your PIN by looking over your shoulder or watching through a camera, then steals the card, they can max it out and you have no recourse - you have agreed to be responsible for any transactions with a valid PIN.  This does not get recorded on the CC company's stats as credit card fraud, so it looks like the system is more secure.  With signed credit card slips, you have proof that it isn't your signature. \n\n   Advice - use a CC with a low limit like $500 or $1000 for wandering around shopping or a debit card with a low daily limit."}, {"author_name": "Benjol", "gravatar_hash": "17326c3e593a14ed7f509359c6f28283", "author_url": null, "date": "Nov 09, 2011", "message": "Just want to echo VonC's comment.
