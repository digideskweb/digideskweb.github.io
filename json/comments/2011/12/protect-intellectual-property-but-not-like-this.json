You yourself are entitled to this because you put forth not only the creativity but you put forth the EFFORT.  You stayed up long nights writing the lyrics and you sweat your a** off recording it.\n\nThen one day your best friend hears it and copies it and throws up a youtube video with YOUR music in the background.  The video is a big hit not only for the actual video content but also for YOUR MUSICAL soundtrack right in the background.  Your best friend generates $$$ due to advertising on YouTube.  Your best friend just got over 100 million views of the video.  His pockets just got heavier, and YouTube o.. we won't even go there..lets just say they made a nice chunk of change.\n\nBut you, poor little you...all that sweating, staying up at night only to have your content stolen is now down the drain.  Of course you should support SOPA, it protects the little guys.

The fact of the matter is that either 1) the song is already popular, and so people are buying your song anyway. You still make your money. or 2) the song was not already popular, in which case it's likely the YouTube video added something to the song; there's new creative work there and so the friend deserves his cut. And while he's at it, the video likely also helps boost direct sales of your original single. In simple terms, music on YouTube is not a substitute for CDs or iTunes, and it's foolish to believe it cannibalizes those sales.  YouTube (and similar technologies) are much more likely to help than hurt."}, {"author_name": "JonH", "gravatar_hash": "fab2c5dd38161cb858b6cbdbfa6189a3", "author_url": null, "date": "Dec 12, 2011", "message": "@Joel Coehoorn,\n\nI respectfully disagree.

Second, it's their context that makes the youtube video successful moreover you don't really earn too much of a quantity. So we are licking rock for water here. \n\nGoing back to the discussion, this law or whatever it is destined to fail just as the DRM stuff and etc. You might not know it but the time has passed and people are not that stupid to get ripped off by actually buying the album of some artist. That's just ridiculous pricing for an album. \n\nMusicians and singers other than the mainstream big-shot pop league, you have one and only one option. Performing your art live or making a twist that would make you distinguished. Otherwise some auto-tuned idiot can look like she can sing but no way. \n\nHad it been as you said, there would be no \"the-incredible\" Soundcloud which we spend most of our time listening to people's hard work for free.
