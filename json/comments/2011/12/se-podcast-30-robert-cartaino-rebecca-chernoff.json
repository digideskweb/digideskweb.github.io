The meta-focused podcasts are, from this listener's perspective, largely a waste of bits.  Maybe you should have a meta-podcast where those interested in how the sausage is made can tune in.  The moot and Dave Winer guest shows really restored my flagging enthusiasm for this podcast: please bring more along those lines.\n\nPlease have a little more respect for your listeners' time and don't give Alex a microphone.  When he has created something or otherwise done something interesting that gives him experience and insight and he has something to teach or inform me, then bring him on to talk about that.  I have been a chief of staff, hired them, and had them reporting to me so I know something about the value of the role both for the exec and as a career development accelerator for the person in the position, so I don't knock him or his role per se, but there is just no place for it on the podcast if he doesn't have any street cred or valuable insight to add.  It is clear he is early in his career and overestimates how insightful his comments are."}, {"author_name": "Jeff Atwood", "gravatar_hash": "51d623f33f8b83095db84ff35e15dbe8", "author_url": "https://profiles.google.com/codinghorror1", "date": "Dec 14, 2011", "message": "@Pat occasionally we mix some meta podcasts in for flavor; the plan is (and has been for a while) for the vast majority of podcasts to have a special guest."}, {"author_name": "Kevin Burke", "gravatar_hash": "41910a452554b187d044c00c576866b1", "author_url": "http://kev.inburke.com", "date": "Jan 20, 2012", "message": "What happened to the podcasts?
