I understand the desire to avoid incentive for sock-puppet voting, but wouldn't an increase in low-quality questions be a greater danger? After all, the former requires people to be greedy and dishonest, while the latter only requires them to have some greed and some laziness."}, {"author_name": "Ben Brocka", "gravatar_hash": "51ec0ca52727a2a471cb40ca684d6c8e", "author_url": null, "date": "Jan 05, 2012", "message": "This is a contest to increase activity on a site, not necessarily the pound-per-pound quality. \n\nStack Overflow doesn't need any contests ever, but many of our smaller communities get a rather low question volume. \n\nIf a site is already getting more questions than they can reasonably moderate they obviously won't start any contests for more questions."}, {"author_name": "Lauren Gundrum", "gravatar_hash": "5114f4806122259270d5da20a3039960", "author_url": null, "date": "Jan 05, 2012", "message": "@Isaac @Powerlord like Ben says, the contest is meant to increase activity on the site.

We try to design contests that don't encourage that type of behavior, though. Here, we're keeping prizes at a pretty low monetary value so it's not something super rare and wondrous that people would only ever be able to get by winning this contest; at the same time, we want the prizes to be worthwhile to people putting some serious effort into their site activity.
