But closing **great** conversations specifically on programming because it doesn't follow the 1000 SE Commandments set out in the infamous 'FAQ' is garbage. Oddly enough I came across one of Jon Skeet\u2019s most popular questions, scrolled to the bottom, and it said: \"Closed because it was off topic\". What?!?! I think the moderatos can\u2019t see the forest through the trees sometimes.\n\nFor example, I got kicked off of Meta SE because I asked a question for an enhancement that everyone thought was trash. OK, you don't have to agree with me, but bombard me with downvotes for a *suggestion* which ultimately had me kicked out is totally off base. After groveling in an email, the moderators were kind enough to allow me back.\n\nYesterday I *genuinely* was trying to help some posts I came across with blog articles I had written. Within a few hours I was warned that self-promotion was not tolerated. Seriously? I am trying to help my fellow programmers.

Is it because I don't follow the 1000 Commandments (it\u2019s probably 1005 by the end here), or that accepting a little constructive criticism about over moderation is due? My guess is it will be the former because my reputation is only 934 so that means I am a nobody.\n\nYou have a decent thing going here SE.

But I can think of hundreds that have been ruined by too little moderation.\" \n\nThis seems to be a false dilemma: most posters in this thread complain of wrong/low quality/defying common sense moderation, not of too much of it. Devil is in the details, and when too many interesting questions are dismissed as \"not a real question\", what is the point of participating? It certainly was real enough for the poster who took precious time to ask a quality question, it was real for those who took precious time to come up with a detailed answer and such.\n\nAlso deleting the content that was legit at the time of its writing erodes confidence. How do we know that our answers are there to stay?

The more choices you put in front of someone, the bigger the chance they'll just skip it entirely. \n\nThat's the beauty of SO's voting system, really - two choices: useful / not-useful. Useful gets more visible, not-useful gets less. Simple, easy to understand, easy to use. \n\nOf course, if you want to *moderate*, there's an entirely separate \"close vote\" system, with many more choices and consequences. You really *should* put a bit more thought into that one, and if a wall of radio buttons scares you off, that's just as well. \n\nBut the end result is a two-dimensional voting system: one tells us whether folks liked a post, another tells us whether it's original, constructive, and appropriate for the site. \n\nYou can vote in one dimension or both, and indeed I've more than once up-voted a post that was an amusing diversion, and then voted to close it - IMHO, there's little harm in having a bit of fun now and then, as long as the mess gets cleaned up once you're through."}, {"author_name": "tim", "gravatar_hash": "94a0e83767dbc71db135454693540015", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 05, 2012", "message": "I used to use SO a lot.

On Reddit, i mostly visit my specialty subreddits (machinelearning, neuro, cogsci, etc) and then there is TrueReddit, which i enjoy immensely.\n\nBut there is another side to this story. The superficial and popular subreddits draw the crowd, which in turn brings the diversity and also some talent to the subreddits.\n\nI reckon the key is a good separation of entertainment and discussion. Which means you create spaces of freedom and those of moderation. Be sure to advertise the moderated spaces in the popular ones, as to encourage migration.\n\nTwo good examples on Reddit would be TrueReddit and r/science. You'll find a lot of good content on there, and some interesting discussions. Bad examples would be r/neuro and r/biology - the former clearly needs a sibling called r/askneuro and the second needs more force in moderating related, but stupid content.\n\nSo, my recommendation would be to allow people to be stupid, but give them their own playground and give serious users a tool to ignore them.\n\nMaybe it's just a subproblem of the information retrieval problems that every \"user-generated content\"-site has. In addition to semantic attributes, also provide facettes on quality markers.\n\nJust thinking aloud.

It's why we have things like corn subsidies.  Those who get them are much more motivated and passionate in lobbying for them than those opposed are in lobbying against them.  And we haven't figured out how to fix that either.  It's why things like SOPA get as afar as they do.\n\nOne can fault those those of us who don't get involved -- we've left the field open for the deletionists.
