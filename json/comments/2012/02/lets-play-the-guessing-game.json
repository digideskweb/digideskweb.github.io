If a person really vaguely recalls something and makes other people guess for him, this really is a bad question. But if a description is more or less precise, then the question becomes pretty much answerable. Also question about single words are quite different from guessing something because the author is not trying to remember something, he is trying to find a name for a specific concept. I\u2019d say this is absolutely answerable. So I\u2019d say questions like this are not inherently vague and thus impractical, only easy to not get them right.\n\nCounterarguments to the rest of the points are similar. The fairness depends on the specificity of the description. In the case with the words I think it is perfectly fair if a person comes up with the most commonly used word for a specific concept. The author can't know which word will suit him best beforehand. With the games or stories the description can be less specific in most cases, but still if it is, the right answer will not be a wild guess, therefore it is absolutely fair.\n\nAs for the educational value: if a question is specific, then you broaden your vocabulary (literally in the case with the words and figuratively with stories and games). With the words it works quite well, to my mind: if a person can't come up with the name of the specific concept himself even after doing some research (in other words, the question is a good question), it is likely to be something others won't know as well. The answer will probably be either a rare word, or a rare meaning for a word.\n\nNow only the helpfullness for the others remains and this may be true because it is not easy to search for a description and not a term (if we don't take the educational value for consideration). But where should I go with this kind of questions then? If I have a good description question (description is specific, I have searched for the answer, and so on), I still need experts to help me, and where shall I look for them if not on StackExchange? Forums, maybe, but they are fit for discussion, not questions.\n\nSo the main point is that these questions are not easy to get right, but this doesn't mean all of them should be frowned upon regardless of the quality."}, {"author_name": "Ilmari Karonen", "gravatar_hash": "9905bf9a7b8d5a587c1bdff07ef2e801", "author_url": "http://vyznev.net/", "date": "Feb 29, 2012", "message": "Well, I'll be sad to see them go.\n\nI don't usually ask questions if I can find the answer myself, and I usually can \u2014 my Google-fu is pretty strong.

I remembered a TV series with a hero that was a researcher or something, who was hemiplegic for reasons I can't remember, and who managed to build a bulky, diving suit-like armor in which he could walk again, but not only, in it he was pretty much unstoppable (I could remember him being hit by a car in his armor, and the armor wouldn't budge). Just like Marilyn/Mecha Maid, he could not be normal: either handicapped, or a superhero, and a researcher to boot (okay, it was just like her up until I got to the bottom of the page; yes, I did the following search in between reading the first half and the second half of the page; anyway\u2026). So I started searching the web for this work, I quickly found <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108843/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MANTIS</a>, but that was not it (the one I remembered had a 70's-80's aesthetic). After some time, I did manage to finally find <a href=\"http://www.forumsfu.com/index.php?topic=547.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">this forum topic</a> which told me it was <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076008/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exo-man</a> (turns out, it was just a made for TV flick, maybe a pilot for a potential series, not a full series). I could tell the same story about <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084988/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blackadder</a>, a few other things I saw on TV a long (or not so long) time ago, etc.\n\nMy point is that just like there are programming, troubleshooting, and many types of questions that are/were traditionally asked on forums and that are \"stuck\" there with either no answer, bad answers, a good answer but three pages afterwards, a good answer which you have to piece out from the various posts as it got progressively discovered, or a good answer but no alternative answer in case you would like more than one option (and as always in forums, a lot of noise, signatures, etc.), such guessing questions are stuck there too and are findable as well and are useful for more than one person, I'm sorry.\n\nI admit it's not a clear cut case, and I have nothing but respect for the way you manage Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange and how you take quasi-editorial decisions so that the sites remain high signal and low noise, and I know that just because something can be done it doesn't mean it should be done, so I'm not going to take you to task for any decision you take about these.
