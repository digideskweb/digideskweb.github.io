I agree with @Ninefingers above that a Server Fault version of this would be very helpful. My firm had to look through the list of top users on SF manually in the hopes of finding someone who looked interested in a new job.

It would be very helpful if I could narrow the C++ candidates in New York to those who have experience in---or at least are explicitly interested in---the finance industry.\n\nOh and if anyone\u2019s wondering,  I was hired for my current job through SO Careers."}, {"author_name": "Grzes", "gravatar_hash": "712248df6de12dd9b8ba73869a110f1f", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 29, 2012", "message": "Looks good.
