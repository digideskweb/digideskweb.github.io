If we wanted to \"permanently dispose of questions at a whim\" it would be a lot easier to just delete them.  There are exceptional cases like TeX where 99% of migrations go very smoothly, but migrations between most sites are just a plain hassle.\n\nWe already have the \"off-topic\" close reason, so \"doesn't belong here\" would be redundant.

Likewise, the answerers on the migrated-to site will be happy to receive an interesting question they can answer. \n\nFor example, zespri was initially unhappy with the migration of his question from SO to DBA.  He thought it wouldn't get much attention.  Then, this happened: http://dba.stackexchange.com/q/14789/2660\n\nOf course, questions that are already answered to the satisfaction of the asker should generally stay on the site where they were first asked.\n\nI can understand that answerers on the migrated-from site will be unhappy to lose a question they can answer.
