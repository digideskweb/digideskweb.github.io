Apart from mathematics and gaming, the largest non-tech SE is English Language &amp; Usage, which is a hundredth of the user base of Stack Overflow. \n\nSo if there were about 30 people at a tech-themed meetup, there might (depending on how avid the non-tech userbase is) be 0.3 people at a non-tech one.
