People that are not familiar with the Area51 process, will be scared off by the sketchy look, and I welcome this new look (which is really based on the general stackexchange.com look - which is really the most logical thing to do). I have previously asked the SE team to apply a graphical theme on the music.stackexchange.com site although it was still in beta, because I felt the sketchy theme was not inviting to new members. I had aready seen that \"User Experience\" had got their own graphical theme while still in beta, but I guess they were in a special position as the site were all about looking good.

I do like how you're keeping the one or two prominent letters from the site title though. Those, besides the eventual custom theme, really reflect that community. And people may think that those letters aren't important, but I think they serve a huge purpose in the growth of a site, which is really what this new beta theme tries to capture. So good thinking on your part.\n\nAgain, excellent work! Love the new modernized theme, but still think the favicon could be worked on. :)"}, {"author_name": "awe", "gravatar_hash": "bb430dc40c4648586562d2ef22c8557b", "author_url": null, "date": "Mar 14, 2012", "message": "@Purmou: The main reason for the theme change is to make the site look LESS unfinished. This is to communicate to new users that this is a site in progress, not an unfinished site. Designing a favicon that \"looks beta\" is not what we want here. The speech bubble communicates that this is a site for a questions and answers community, which is more like the message we want with the design.
