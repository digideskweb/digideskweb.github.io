[deleted by SE staff]) as recommended by SE Inc.  \n* Webapps chooses name from none other than Joel Spolsky himself as the best name for the site  \n* Site gets posted to HackerNews, the king of couch-critics   (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1744583) and gets tons of negative criticism\n* Name gets removed immediately after, I think (80% sure) it may have been the same day.\n\nSure, there could have been other factors that affected it, though I'm not convinced.\n\nWithin the same quote you took you are referring to the elevator pitch, tag-lines and mottos (again, recommended by SE Inc.) for an SE site right?\n\nShow me at least 10 SE sites that have a good one and I'm sold.\n\nThe name isn't about significant differences, it's about identity something that the trilogy and now gaming.stackexchange.com can hold on to and feel as a community on their own. It's the reason why apple.stackexchange call themselves \"Ask Different\" no?\n\nThe real gain is a sub SE site can hold on to identity rather than just be another face in SE crowd. If that's not true then maybe Stack Overflow should regress to coding.stackexchange.com and be part of the family?\n\nStack Exchange overall is a great Q&amp;A but it is the individual sites that attract users. We are way too segregated as a community to think of all of us an one.\n\nIn my opinion the real waste was when everyone got hyped to be a brand, made logos, names and everything, felt all special then got slapped in the face. That was indeed a waste of time and effort.\n\nIt's clear, to me, that SE Inc. aim here is marketing the overall brand of the Stack Exchange Network so I just wish this silly identity topic stops coming up, if that's how it is going to be."}, {"author_name": "Julian", "gravatar_hash": "4208f6b083ebfd8f604e50860ad3c1be", "author_url": null, "date": "Jun 26, 2012", "message": "What have you done against domain squatters during the domain brainstorming?"}, {"author_name": "Shog9", "gravatar_hash": "a0161feded4a20b2636f9a0177738316", "author_url": null, "date": "Jun 26, 2012", "message": "@phwd: I was there too - there's a reason I linked to both the Cooking and Web Apps meta discussions...

All the drama wrought by these naming discussions is for naught when the only meaningful part of the brand is \"SE\".
