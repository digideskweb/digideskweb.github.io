And about who could say the most words on Meta about which tags should be deleted, which rules to create, how to shape, limit and constrain the site. \n\nBecause apparently, the people who want to influence SO think it looks untidy if people ask too many questions. Because SO is a community of programmers, and if there's one trait you can rely on finding among programmers, it's OCD. Everything must be in its place, tagged in the right way, following the right template, and NOTHING must be duplicated, nothing must be *wrong*, nothing must fall outside my norms and expectations.\n\nAnd so, questions can be deleted if they don't conform. Comments can be deleted because they're not supposed to contain anything important *anyway*. \n\nAnd, I might add, given your tweets about Wikipedia just a day or two, there's a certain irony here.\n\nSO and Wikipedia are both suffering from a small \"ruling\" (I realize that word is contentious among, well, the ruling clique) clique who have *their* idea of what's relevant and what is not, and who will gladly and uncritically delete and censor anything that does not fit their vision, no matter how many newcomers are turned away, and no matter how much it isolates them and impoverishes the site.\n\nOn Wikipedia, otherwise well-written and high-quality articles are deleted because of the absurd and inconsistently applied \"notability\" requirement, discouraging many people form contributing. Quality has nothing to do with it. You just chose to write about something that we, the ruling elite, found irrelevant, so we're going to delete it.\n\nOn SO, otherwise well-written high-quality questions or answers have to be defended almost on a monthly basis, against hordes of Meta'ers or moderators who need something to delete, something to retag, something to CHANGE and REDUCE. \n\nUtterly harmless little touches like ending an answer with \"Hope this helps\" get silently edited out because it looks untidy -- and if it turns away the person who wrote the answer, who just wanted to be helpful and add a human touch, sees his answer reduced to an impersonal blob, then that's an acceptable loss.\n\nQuestions with a thousand or more upvotes and which have been favorited just as many times are attempted deleted because, while the question is obviously popular and helps a lot of people, it doesn't conform to the \"accepted\" template of \"how a SO question should be structured\".\n\nComments get deleted because, while they obviously add information that's not present in the answer, the comment thread had gotten long enough that \"it looked untidy\".\n\nA reminder to be friendly to newbies is much needed, and a great start. But actions speak louder than words; it doesn't matter how friendly you are to a newbie, if everything he writes, questions, comments or answers, is being butchered, if legitimate content is sacrificed just to satisfy a group of programmers' collective OCD.\n\nThis is a great initiative.

Even though I read the FAQ before attempting to post my first question in SO (a simple question of 'here's my code, this is what it does, this is what I want it to do, I've tried reworking the thing for over a month-now over a year-,and what am I doing wrong?) and applied both the letter and spirit of the FAQ to my question, I was still told to read the FAQ before asking any questions.

Try asking a question and see how many \"hey, how about this!\" prompts you get as you compose the question. Really go through the motions, write an actual question.

Seems so. The prompts that are presented can be mere word hits if one doesn't include a tag as a filter. They are not ranked by number of votes, by number of answers or by date (that's a separate tab). There is no UI for advanced search - just a separate page with suggestions. If you want users to 'do the right thing' you make it easy. But whatever. \u2013 skinnyTOD Jun 15 at 5:05 \n  \t\n \t\n@skinny I don't think you actually know how the site works. 1) Try entering \"java generics\" in the search and see what happens. 2) Try asking a question as a new user (open an anonymous browser page) and see what happens. \u2013 Jeff Atwood\u2666 Jun 15 at 5:09\n\t\n@jeff atwood: So I don't know hw the site works?

This is completely automatic and true for the top 60 tags, as documented on the stackoverflow.com/search page. That's why your statement that \"users need to enter [tag]\" is totally incorrect, at least for the 60 most common tags. \u2013 Jeff Atwood\u2666 Jun 15 at 5:31\n \t \n\t\nI did do that prior to my last comment. The results were exactly the same and no, I did not see your point and it was not obvious that a tag search was automatic. I see that now. My point however remains: search here is weak in terms of UI/usability (as mentioned, no sort, no filter). I don't get why that should be. Example: do a search for \"UIImage crop\" (no quotes). Loads of hits in no apparent order. Click on the 'votes' tab - is that votes of my search result? Appears not. Why not? Click on 'newest' or 'active' and it appears to be hits only for 'UIImage'. Confusing/ not helpful. \u2013 skinnyTOD Jun 15 at 6:13 \n \n\t\n@Jeff I find SO's search largely helpful.

Your stats for upvotes vs downvotes look great however the number I would be interested in seeing is the co-relation between downvotes and contribution. Your numbers doesn't necessarily mean that you are right in your assumption that downvotes are serving the intended informational purpose.

Most times you just ignore it by giving them the benefit of their age, other times you sit them down on your lap and 'explain' to them why what they did was wrong. \n\nAgain I understand the reasoning however I just think we have enough negativity in our society, the last thing we need is a learning place like SO to judge us for our language or our lack of ability to convey the problem.\n\nI understand that in the effort to promote positive behavior you guys removed the WSOIN post. Although it is slightly hard to digest as most of us here thought of the site as community-driven. Again I understand the underlying reasoning.

While civility is (of course!) still required on meta at all times under penalty of death, naturally, pointing out that \"the way some people respond on meta\" isn't particularly relevant to the main sites at all.

However, in practice important and necessary clarifications do sometimes need to live on permanently in the comments. So having all comments \"fade away\" after a month would be harmful.\n\nAnyway, we do this already by suppressing the display of any more than 5 comments behind a \"click to see more\" and prioritizing comments with upvotes in that 5 comment list.

A question that goes unasked is worse than one that goes unanswered.\n\n2) Disallow arbitrary deletion of questions by *anyone* unless they are patently *offensive* (eg: \"Why do  programmers write crappy code?\"). If a question is poorly researched or obviously homework bait, DON'T ANSWER IT. That way it stays at zero votes, or at the very least, unanswered.\n\n3) Exact duplicate questions can be auto-closed after being marked as duplicates and linked off of the question they are a duplicate of (to preserve that the question was asked and any comments).\n\n4) Questions that become discussions (\"What framework should I use to build my web site in Python?\") should NOT be automatically closed or deleted. If there is a spirited discussion with lots of opinion, this is still VALUABLE. Instead, these can be moved over to an overflow section, perhaps (Stack Overflow Overflow?) so that it is marginalized, but not stifled.\n\n5) Keep everything TRANSPARENT. All upvotes, downvotes, comments, deletions, etc. should be recorded in history. There is, in my mind, nothing worse and discouraging that someone's innocent questions/thoughts disappearing arbitrarily. \n\nI will repeat the primary thesis of my suggestion again: IGNORE bad questions, IGNORE suspicious homework assistance requests, IGNORE snarky comments, IGNORE self-important behavior, stick to and SUPPORT stuff that ADDS VALUE. It's like training toddlers to become good functioning citizens (ignored bad behavior has less likelihood of returning); it should work for SO.\n\nMy 2 cents."}, {"author_name": "\u4e01\u5c0f\u8d1d", "gravatar_hash": "7103b2972d6ebd7702e4d3a3999eb8a7", "author_url": "http://dingxiaobei.com/", "date": "Jul 23, 2012", "message": "Constant today is tomorrow's variable"}, {"author_name": "Rig Perez", "gravatar_hash": "e3c2fe034437705ab357219111915f3c", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 23, 2012", "message": "@Kevin DreamInCode is the worst for cult culture.

A couple of comments get posted asking for clarification - so far so good. But then within fifteen to thirty minutes the question is closed, sometimes even after a reasonable best-guess-at-what-the-OP-meant answer has been posted.\n\nThe people closing these questions seem to think that the OP should sit there clicking refresh over and over waiting for a response and thus immediately see the request for clarification and edit the question straight away - at least one such \"closer\" confirmed this for me explicitly in a comment.

It has several well-known (among the regulars, of course) jokey questions and answers that simply have no place on anything but a humor site.

I think the lifetime moderator policy should be revisited. think that lifetime moderators is partly what leads to calcification of the site... suggest there be a way for users to vote to replace a moderator. radical? or natural?\n\nheres a radical idea-- let the community decide what posts to kill based solely on votes, and skip the question closing mechanism. try it out somewhere. create a sandbox where people can experiment and try out new ideas with low risk, and promote the best ideas to other sites. let some sites customize their quality mechanisms.\n\nanother idea. allow very small stackexchanges to be started by anyone who can get just a few people to join. ie low threshhold. let people create their own sites and grow them organically. let people vote by where they participate. thats the ultimate voting of all.\n\nanyway I really like stackexchange software but what I like the most is that its *evolved* over time. I think further evolution is possible, maybe even necessary. I think sometimes radical changes can lead to radical improvements. there are some improvements that are nonlinear. think that the feature space for this type of collaborative software is still not very fully explored. there are lots of other mechanisms/ideas/features to try out. think the skys the limit.\n\nhere is another thread that some may find relevant to this subject. its a small, rather arcane stackexchange struggling to deal with a significant drop in participation. they are proposing \"expanding the scope\" but I think even that alone is somewhat futile. its as if they imagine that all they have to do is issue a post, or a proclamation on meta, that they are widening the scope, and magically new questions will show up. something much deeper, \"structural\" is in play, as you indicate in your analysis above. \n\nhttp://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1572/on-modifying-our-scope-a-proposal\n\n\nhope you revisit this subject. a summer of luv is a start but only a temporary fix. theres something much deeper going on here. you're on the right track. but its a long track. =)"}, {"author_name": "Motion Graphics", "gravatar_hash": "24cf897e6275ade38ff3cc8211d0f656", "author_url": "http://www.hurricanemedia.co.uk", "date": "Oct 01, 2012", "message": "Ok so Stack Exchange is going to be a friendly place from now on then"}, {"author_name": "Modele Perdele", "gravatar_hash": "e8d6ff64fc875e516aabccbbd5f98e77", "author_url": "http://www.dekoris.ro", "date": "Nov 29, 2012", "message": "A couple of comments get posted asking for clarification \u2013 so far so good.
