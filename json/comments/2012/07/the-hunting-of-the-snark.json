How do \"thank you\" *comments* make it harder to find *answers*?\n\nThis is not a crappy web forum.

Can you give us an example of where this is *actually* a problem? A link to a question where the answers are harder to find because of too many \"thank you\" comments?\n\nAs @Rachel says, a comment which contributes to making SO a nicer, friendlier place where people actually feel welcome, and *dare* to ask questions or post answers is certainly not \"useless\". \n\n&gt; Can I just go on record that I think we are expending time, energy and money vastly out of proportion to the perceived \u201cpr0blem?\u201d\n\n&gt; Negative comments are already adequately handled by the flagging system.\n\nWell, given that these comments still exist, they are clearly not \"adequately handled\". And even if they are quickly removed, the damage is done, to some extent. Nasty, angry snarky comments tend to leave an impression even if they get deleted after they were read.\n\nAnd I get that you don't have a problem with how unfriendly SO can sometimes seem. But what if others do? What if newcomers are turned away by it? What if regulars stop answering questions because they just no longer feel welcome or appreciated?\n\nI can't read Joel's mind, but I'm guessing that he did not institute a \"Summer of Love\" because he was worried that Robert Harvey was feeling unloved on SO. You know how the place works, people know you and generally respect you. You have a high rep and a little diamond next to your name. So yes, of course the place is lovely to someone like you (and, generally speaking, to me, and most other regulars) But not everyone is in our position. Most likely this effort is because of how people who are not in your position, who are newcomers to the site, or who have been turned away by the rule-mongering or by angry comments, by questions being closed/deleted too quickly, by the feeling that they're just not welcome.\n\nI guess I'll go on record saying that I think the time, energy and money expended on this is a damn good thing, it's long overdue, and I hope to see more like this.\n\nOn a side note, I freely admit that I've posted more than a few comments along the lines of \"interesting question, +1\", because I feel it's worth it to encourage people (and, of course, because I felt it *was* an interesting question, and one that I'd like to see answered), to make them feel that they're not just posting their question into an empty void, and, at times, to forestall close-votes and angry comments. People tend to behave better when others have already expressed that they see value in a question.\n\nPerhaps I am guilty of the deadly sin of cluttering up SO, and perhaps someone should go through aaaalllll my comments and delete all the offending ones.\nBut I think the \"human touch\" is important. And I think that, when we actually have a site which distinguishes between comments and answers, which lets me find answers regardless of how many \"me too\" comments have been posted, we should make the most of it. Not to needlessly spam comments everywhere, but to make the site a nicer place to be.\n\nBut really, if I can't say \"thank you\", or \"That's a really good question. I'd like to know the answer to this too\" without risking my comments being removed, then I start questioning why I bother answering questions in the first place.\n\nI do it to help people. I'm a human being interacting with human beings. Reduce me to a cog in a machine, and I'll lose interest. I don't contribute to Wikipedia because I have no interest in writing an encyclopedia. I don't want to share my knowledge with an impersonal webserver. But I do genuinely enjoy sharing my knowledge with *people*. And the comments are pretty vital in keeping that \"human\" element. It feels genuinely nice when people say \"thank you\". It reminds me why I've spent so many hours answering questions here.\n\nAnd once or twice, I've asked a question which was faced with pointless comments along the lines of \"you shouldn't worry about this\", or \"what do you need to know that for?\" and then someone saying \"hey, that's a good question\" actually helps as well.\n\nThe cold heartless robots at Meta might not appreciate that kind of thing, but tough luck. I do. I *want* to see a certain number of comments around whose only purpose is to be friendly and to express enthusiasm about a question or an answer.

I know Hassan can't read this (assuming he was serious about leaving because of a comment on a blog post), but this is for anyone else who agrees with this.\n\nRules exist to serve the spirit that engineered them. Thus, re-evaluating a rule to see if the rule is properly serving that spirit. So let's talk about the spirit of Stack Overflow.\n\nStack Overflow does not exist to create a community; it exists to create *information*. That is its purpose. If there is a community here, it is only as a necessary evil.\n\n2 years from now, your \"+1 thanks!\" comment will be completely meaningless. The person reading it doesn't know you or the person you're talking to. What *they* will see is a question with an upvoted answer, possibly accepted. Because they're not interested in the community; they're here for *information*.\n\nInformation needs to be dispassionate.\n\nPoliteness is not a bad thing, when dealing with people. But we're *not* dealing with people. We're dealing with questions and answers. The entire Stack Exchange system is designed to make this exchange as impersonal as humanly possible. Because once it starts getting personal, people start getting chatty. People start getting personally upset when someone downvotes one of their questions/answers. And so forth.\n\nIn short, it starts becoming a forum.\n\nNo matter how nice, friendly, genuinely courteous your comment is, if it is not in some way contributing to the generation of good information, it is noise. Anything that is not information, or something needed to *create* information, is by definition unwanted. It takes up time from every reader who reads it.\n\nSuch comments have value only for two people: the person making the comment (who feels better about themselves for thanking them) and the person receiving the comment.\n\nNow, you could argue that it has value for anyone who feels warm and fuzzy when they see one person thanking another. It creates a friendly atmosphere. Who feels that this makes the atmosphere more comfortable. Well... that's not a good thing. Because again, this *encourages* that behavior, leading to much more chat and much less info.\n\nStack Overflow should not have a friendly atmosphere. It should not have a harsh atmosphere. If it must have an \"atmosphere\" at all, it should be of professionalism. Cold and clinical. You're here to give and get information; you don't care who gives it or who takes it.\n\nThe rules against \"+1 thanks\" comments exists to prevent the decay from cold information to chatty forum-like behavior. I believe that it serves this purpose well."}, {"author_name": "skinnytod", "gravatar_hash": "e2aa4cd8ca03c4b2f71c6443f6e437b1", "author_url": null, "date": "Aug 01, 2012", "message": "<blockquote>\nStack Overflow does not exist to create a community; it exists to create *information*.

At best it is a <b>feeder</b> to a possible knowledge base. It is worthwhile? Yes. Is it helpful to users? Yes. But please, let's not encourage some fantasy that it is any more than a collection of ephemeral questions of varying clarity, with answers of varying quality and correctness. It is not <i>small science</i> (whatever the frack that was supposed to mean). It is simply a forum with some rules. That's it. That's all.\nThe quote above and the rest of the post from <i>@Nicol Bolas </i> and along with others expressing similar points of view is <strong>future oriented</strong>: that someone will come by at some ideal future time and see expressions of thanks, etc. as merely crumbs on the keyboard, annoying litter left by the last users at the picnic table. But we humans ask and answer questions in the <strong>present</strong>. I appreciate hearing if my answer helped and I am glad to let someone know that their efforts helped me. My prime motivation for helping someone is not getting some meaningless &quot;rep&quot; points or silly &quot;badges.&quot; Sure, those are a fun game at first but they are a side issue and hopefully not what truly motivates someone to contribute to SO.\nMost users come with their questions to help them with a problem they face in the present. Those of us who may have more experience answer in the present. We don't do it to build a &quot;knowledge base&quot; for some ideal future. We do it to help someone, just as we have been helped. This is called &quot;community.&quot;\nIf SO/SE wants to build knowledge bases, I wholeheartedly support that, and have posted my suggestions on Meta numerous times. It is not going to work by doubling down on the existing rigid rules. There needs to be a process separate from the feeder Q+A which elevates questions and answers to canonical status and then applies the stylistic and technical editing efforts which, in my opinion, are mostly wasted on the raw feeder Q+A.\nSummer of Love?

If all you are doing is helping one person with their personal problems, you're using SO wrong.\n\nThere is a reason why we have \"too localized\" as a closed reason: because such questions only will be helpful to that person and no one else. The reason we have voting by people who aren't the asker is because we want the community's input.

If what we did was only to help someone in the present, we wouldn't need voting at all.\n\nIt is important to understand the difference between \"help\" and Q&amp;A. \"Help\" is something that requires dialog, which SE's Q&amp;A methodology expressly forbids (or at least channels, redirects, and minimizes). SE doesn't provide \"help\"; that's not its purpose.\n\n&gt; Go find a friend who is just learning to program, such as a nephew, the neighbor kid, your aunt, or someone volunteering their time to work on their church website, and have them post a question on Stack Overflow. \n\nIf you're \"just learning to program,\" you don't need Stack Overflow. You need someone who's going to sit down with you and teach you stuff. You need someone who is going to stop and figure out what you really mean by your question by engaging in a dialog with you.\n\nIn short, you need *help*, not Q&amp;A. SO is not intended to be all things to all people. This is exemplified in your DBA example; your friend needed someone to engage in a dialog with in order to get her problem fixed.\n\nQ&amp;A isn't about dialog.\n\nThat's why we close broad questions that are typically asked by people \"just learning\": 'how do I make a website?' and so forth."}, {"author_name": "James Mortensen", "gravatar_hash": "d4518e6223a1a82f53dc4919d0165151", "author_url": "http://pm.stackexchange.com/users/34/jmort253", "date": "Aug 01, 2012", "message": "&gt; \"If you\u2019re \u201cjust learning to program,\u201d you don\u2019t need Stack Overflow.

This takes many forms -- from the speed with which off topic questions are closed and deleted, the purging of historical questions, to discouraging social niceties that do not add content.\n\nAs a result, this has become a less pleasant place to be, both for veterans and new questioners.  \n\nHow big a problem is this?  I don't know.  A peak at the front page shows no shortage of questions, including those from relative newcomers.  But IMO, it leaves SO open to competition that is a bit more welcoming of their participants as human beings, rather than cogs in a content machine.

If you have something important to add to the answer, propose an edit.  I'd much rather that all content required of the answer was placed *in the answer*, and that comments were just that--comments on the post.  I'd argue that the format of SE is such that all pertinent content ought to be contained within the question and the answer, and that you shouldn't need to read the comments to understand them.  That's a major reason why we have the editing system after all, right?  To improve relevant content after it's been posted?

You don't collect good information by encouraging people who LIKE noise and discouraging people who don't.\n\nFor those who don't believe that it's not only about the interface, case study: Perlmonks website. Pure annoying forum format/interface. STILL one of the main sources for Perl Q&amp;A, perhaps more pre-eminent than SO's Perl tag (I wouldn't presume to know enough to be able to weight the two, but my really difficult Perl questions more frequently google-find answers on PM than SO). Yet, it has a community with the same non-nonsense noise/info ratio mindset, which is what makes it effective.\n\n==============================\n\n2) I would like to second a couple of people's opinion from above. The tone and behavior of the proponents of \"fuzziness\" on this comment thread was 2x more unfriendly and rude than MOST of the \"rude\" comments Joel used as examples. If these are a good sample of who would be setting the new tone for SO, you will be eventually left with a lot of newbies posting crappy questions, and people posting \"me too\" \"I like that\" \"howdy ya'll\" comments. The same exact useless forum content that SO was meant to phase out. \n\n@skinnytod - I may be a cold robotic automaton who's a poster child for Aspergers. But I'm a cold robotic automaton who's a poster child for Aspergers who provided 1,285 mostly-useful answers and little fluff comparatively.\n\n==============================\n\n3) Also, Joel - this is the same old discussion (same on a philosophical level) that's been already joined by you once before, when you finally had to agree that a question upvote must be worth less than the answer one - because experts providing good answers are what makes this network tick, not people with a lack of assorted good qualities who can't be bothered to read the FAQ or a couple of other questions before flooding the site with bad quality questions, or people who want to use the site to showcase just how friendly they personally are. As this comment thread shows, you can't thread the goldilocks middle ground - you will either alienate the skinnytod's of the world or Robert Harvey's.
