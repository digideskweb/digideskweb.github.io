This is exactly the kind of thing I wanted to see.\n\nI've said it a jillion times, but I'm gonna say it again: <b>civility has been required under penalty of extreme moderation banhammer from day zero of Stack Overflow</b>.\n\nI'm concerned, though, that some seem to see \"infinite\" civility -- to the point of writing a small, intimate novella to each new question asker -- as a solution. I am not sure it is. Here is why.\n\n1. When most people complain about rudeness on Stack Exchange, it's rarely actual rudeness. What they're really communicating is their belief that Stack Exchange's rules are too strict. \"This is the Internet, man, how dare you tell me my question/answer/comment is not good enough for your sites. JERKS!\"\n\n2. Adding an infinity of \"extra niceness\" will do virtually nothing to change point #1.\n\nPlease do not read this as an attack on civility because it is not.  Civility is now, and has always been, a pillar of the Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange community.\n\nI just don't believe, in my heart of hearts, that a bunch of \"extra\" friendliness on top of our common standard of civility, will convince users that these rules Stack Exchange has, that they frequently view as too strict and unfair and jerk-y, are suddenly <i>awesome</i>.\n\nIt's also asking a lot of our existing users, who not only have to be perfectly 100% civil all the time, but also-oh-by-the-way, we need you to be SUPER friendly to new users. The ones who didn't bother reading the FAQ even a little or for that matter any of the other questions on the site to get a sense of what goes on there.\n\n<b>Uber-extra-friendliness makes more sense on smaller sites where the users have less to do, and the sites fundamentally <i>need</i> more new users to grow.</b> So on a site like http://bicycles.stackexchange.com absolutely. Totally makes sense. But on Stack Overflow, which gets 6k+ questions <i>per day</i> and is already enormous? (fun experiment: visit the sites page and calculate how many SE sites Stack Overflow would be bigger than in a single day) Stack Overflow is pretty much already the Wikipedia of programming. It's a bit of a stretch to argue that Stack Overflow *needs* to go far out of its way (again, fundamental civility is bedrock, I mean writing friendly novellas) to educate and woo new users, otherwise it will die a horrible, insular death.\n\nThat seems... unlikely.\n\nIt's not like New York City has an extra special welcoming committee waiting for you when you cross the city line, or anything.

Perhaps there should be room for newcomers to make a misstep or two before they're descended on by the hordes eager to fill their question-closing quota. And perhaps we should, just sometimes, allow people to say \"hi\", or \"hope that helps\" in their questions or answers. Perhaps that would be the civil thing to do. Perhaps, sometimes, these complaints about rudeness are because certain rules, and certain people's interpretation and enforcement of the rules, *is* rude.)\n\nApart from that, it's also a strawman argument. Because some people don't understand/don't agree with the rules, we shouldn't strive to be as civil *as possible*. What?\n\nOr, \"because SO is already a big site, and doesn't desperately need to grow, we don't need to go out of our way to make newcomers feel welcome\"\n\nWhat happened to the whole \"make the internet a better place\" thing?\n\nWhy should we *not* try to be as civil as possible? No one is asking for the impossible, and I see no requirement for complete and total 100% perfect friendliness, helpfulness and civility with a sprinkling of infinite patience.\n\nBut I don't see the problem in striving for it, in trying to move in that general direction."}, {"author_name": "Raj", "gravatar_hash": "1e5319be312a6d19f98442d8894f6fe2", "author_url": null, "date": "Jul 26, 2012", "message": "Give me teh codez!!!"}, {"author_name": "roger", "gravatar_hash": "9887130ab70f6e66b50f2c5e19272c67", "author_url": "http://freeldssheetmusic.org", "date": "Jul 26, 2012", "message": "I would agree that it's friendlier...except for moderators marking questions as closed that are actually quite useful.
