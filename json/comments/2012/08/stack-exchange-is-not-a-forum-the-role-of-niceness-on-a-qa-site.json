It's as unfriendly and hostile as the community's moderator gangs. I rarely use SO any more, aside from asking an occasional question, because the site is just so damn unfriendly. And I'm no noob. I know what kind of questions the moderation police dislikes and I'm not even talking about those. Just a few days ago I posted a question about some git nuance. It took 5 minutes to get 2 close votes as a dup - even though I explicitly explained why it's subtly different then the other questions in advance. My point isn't to rant about this particular question. I just want to convey the experience - I had to spend 15 minutes arguing, vying for moderator attention, asking friends to upvote and repeatedly re-edit my question to clarify why it's not a dup. In the end it were my programmer facebook friends who knew the answer. The community basically did not help at all. \nAt a certain point a colleague saw the question and said he would upvote it but he never used SO before and doesn't have enough rep to do so. The upshot of that conversation was that I told him this isn't a community worth participating in, to he probably shouldn't bother opening an account.\nEvery day that passes the site's marginal value for additional questions &amp; answers dwindles. Some of it is because so many questions have already been answered - so there's really no point in participating aside from some some weird Tamagoochi devotion to weeding and trimming it. I actually did that for a while, because the site's early years were that much fun and it meant a lot for me. Another reason is the amount of friction you get when you try to participate. It seems like every damn question I ever ask gets closed down, migrated to some other site, then migrated back. It's just too much. I actually get stressed by the idea of posting a question, knowing that I have to carefully watch and guard it against hoards of moderators before it has a chance to be seen by someone who would answer. That's. Not. Fun.\nI don't remember the motto being \"we're jackasses that are always technically correct\" when I signed up. It was about a wiki/q&amp;a/digg kind of thing - I'm really quite sure being an asshole wasn't in that Venn diagram.\n\nToday I had a question - a technical question that I really wanted to ask - but I didn't. I couldn't. The question was whether or not somebody knew of a good linux tool that does Email-&gt;HTTP. I tried to think which forum was right for this, but I just couldn't figure it out. I was positive it would get shut down on any of them. It's a poll question, or it's not about programming, and it's not about being an admin, it's not a \"user\" question, blah, blah, blah. So I just didn't. I almost asked it on Quora - that's how desperate I was. Almost.\nIt saddens (yes, saddens) me to see this great endeavor slowly crumble and decay into a weird, unfriendly, factioned mess. At least the summer of love thing gave me some hope that some people are aware of the problem. But now this unapologetically hostile BS.

Not only is it a learned skill that SE does little to teach. It's also impossible to anticipate everyone's emotional reactions to it. Or how they'll misread it. Or how they'll try to answer a different question, or re-define your problem. In fact, the more you try to anticipate these things, by adding lots of additional points to the question, the more they'll fail to read everything, and the more problems it will cause.\n\nSE needs an explicit mechanism to help newbies improve their question answering skills, and to convey feedback from moderators in a structured way.

Kind of obvious, you might say.\n\nBut with time it also became <em>a place to try and help others, by answering their questions</em>.\n\nAfter a while, I got to 2K, and questions were getting harder to answer, so I got interested in a more curating role.

I'm not sure how SO mods cope to be honest.\n\nIt seems inevitable to me that with time, more and more emphasis will have to be put on curating existing content and culling new duplicate content. The challenge is to retain people's interest.\n\nFrankly, I'm not sure that there is much more in the way of technical solutions than what we already have for:\n\n- detecting duplicates before they're even asked\n- discouraging 'bad' content\n- providing curating tools.\n\nYannis' idea is <strong>very</strong> interesting (breaking SO up into smaller, human-sized sites).

I've been on this site for a while now (nearly three years), but it's come to the point where it's like YouTube commenters have been given permission to run the place. Asking a question here (or on any SE site) should NOT be a source for pain... And yet it frequently is.\n\nThere seems to be a sort of Nazi league that enjoys finding fault in anything posted -- even when there's nothing wrong. If you catch their attention then, by God, you're in for a struggle.\n\nI once had a question moved as \"off topic\" from SO to SU to SF, and eventually back to SO. Jeff literally had to step in. It was ABSURD. (The question, he confirmed, was within the scope of SO, and should never have been voted otherwise.)\n\nHow does this happen? I've been asking this for a while now, but it's been falling on deaf ears.\n\nThe fundamental problem with SE sites (and the reason they will continue to degrade until something is done) is that moderator powers are given to people as a reward for their knowledge -- NOT for having good moderator skills.\n\nOddly enough, and perhaps this is just me, but I don't find that those with the most knowledge always have the best social skills. In fact, it's usually the opposite.\n\nCommunity management, in all its forms, is a particular skill. It requires patience, understanding, and excellent communication skills. Not many people are suited for it, and yet this is a community (of sorts) which hands out those powers to just about anyone.\n\nIt's no wonder that getting an answer to your question can be so painful.\n\nSE sites have revolutionized Q&amp;A sites and forums, no question. They're a brilliant and logical progression on the internet, but they need to KEEP evolving.\n\nThe point of this blog post is to remind everyone that the focus of SE sites is INFORMATION, and I completely agree. Sadly, it's overzealous moderation by ill-suited members that is making this information exchange become a painful and personal experience. You might argue that this is the best way to ensure only good content is created and maintained on SE sites, but it overlooks two important issues: \n\n1. New members need to be eased into this style of site, and the culture to expect here. (It's still new to people, after all.)\n\n2. We're people, not machines.

This process is completely automated.\n\nPart of this change was removing the 1 rep penalty for downvotes on questions; downvotes represent part of the equation used for the low-quality filters.

Especially most of what Assaf said in the 8th comment. As well as what Hugo said:\n\n\"While the SE sites are well designed around our human nature, the one thing they fail to address is the fact that asking a good question is very difficult. Not only is it a learned skill that SE does little to teach. It\u2019s also impossible to anticipate everyone\u2019s emotional reactions to it. Or how they\u2019ll misread it. Or how they\u2019ll try to answer a different question, or re-define your problem. In fact, the more you try to anticipate these things, by adding lots of additional points to the question, the more they\u2019ll fail to read everything, and the more problems it will cause.\"\n\n\nNearly all the reasons a question gets closed/downvoted/belittled/etc \nis because of misreading, and personal opinionated descisions. \nMost of the things that get a question closed or downvoted is just because someone thinks that it is a \"shopping question\" or other \"off-topic\". Its a joke. Ive seen one guy tell an Original Poster that his question was was off-topic, yet he contributed to a question that was nearly identical except it was for a different programming lanquage. Double standards? a Simple Opinion? \n\nI agree with Assaf, if this is how the SE sites want to go, down this path, I agree that as he said \"the moderation will soon be easier\". but what I take into account, many of the more serious intelligent users will not use this anymore as a resource, but these sites will flood with noob questions. I mean FLOOD. So really I think the moderation will get more intense as only the fools that everyone is talking about here will flock to this site, as it has slowly been becoming a very unuseful site for people who are highly intelligent with lots of information to provide others to prevent these stupid questions. \n\nAnother thing is, its really annoying when people will delete content from an answer stating its off-topic, even thought the other 99% is on topic, despite the content being VERY VALUABLE, or not anywhere else to be found on the internet, or an addition to a great resource, which would definitely prevent any other stupid questions on that topic. \nFor instance. On the Android Enthusiasts Q&amp;A, someone explained to me what a loop device is, (which is what I asked) and also explained how to find it, how to use it, how to implement it into the kernel, and how to alter it. But all the content was deleted besides what a loop device is because that was the main question..  To this day, there is NO OTHER SITE ON THE ENTIRE NET that explains those things that, that guy did. There is really no other information in regards to loop devices, or how to implement it, or anything else he explained. So instead of Android enthusiasts being the only site on the net with that WONDERFUL information found nowhere else, it was deleted as it was \"development\" which is off-topic there. So yeah just remove the great content, screw it, who cares if it can not be found anywhere else on the net. Just delete it because the mods feel like it. \n\nAnother example on android enthusiasts: \nsomeone asked how to save files to an sd card from the google play store. \nit was instantly closed as being a duplicate. The \"supposed\" duplicate was a question on alternative markets other than the google play store. It had a tiny little sentence that said on an \"alternative\" market you can save the files without installing... \n\nThe guy begged and pleaded, that his was way different, (which is absolutely was.. You'd have to be an idiot to think those were the same..) yet because in a mod's oppinion they were the same..  \nLike I said, the personal opinion thing. Most of these rules can just depend on how you take it, and how you think about it and your personal opinion on the subject. \n\n\nI think its a joke. The whole system now.\n\nA good reason why Forums are better than this set up. This is find for simple questions with one answer. But if you need to work something out you need a forum post. Say you have a problem. Someone gives you an answer to try to fix it. It doesnt work, or there is a new problem. you now have to open another question, making more useless content, and not helping anyone but the original poster. Isnt the traffic on these sites supposed to be coming from search engines? Well thats who views these old questions. If the person has to start another question for the same problem, thats just one solution the person will probably never find. Really beneficial right?\n\nand its funny all the people who go around downvoting, deleting and trimming content are people who spend basically their whole day on these sites, literally daily. Spend nearly 2 minutes or less on a question, skim through it, and make an opinion, without even thinking twice or verifying their actions. \nThose are the people who will stay. They can trim these sites down of the many useful information ridden questions, and make it a more \"comfortable\" site for themselves, and their flock of noobs who come flocking. \n\nbut yeah its all good. Do what you guys wanna do on this site. its yours. Screw the community that makes it what it is. ;) \nBest of Luck. \nBut yeah you never know. Maybe it will be filled with semi intelligent people.

He was calling out the OP for attacking a straw man to prove his point.  Whether or not it was accidental, he did it and based much of his point on that one statement.  I'm not sure if your main source for understanding is an education in philosophy, or wikipedia, so I'll explain where you went wrong from the ground up.\n\nYou have it right that this logical fallacy is based on obscuring the original point into something you can more easily attack, but the point being made by @Joshua Flynn was that the OP created a straw man when he took this point\n\n\"You might think you hang out on SO because people are nice there [...]but if Stack Overflow was full of very nice, impeccably polite misinformation\u2026 It wouldn\u2019t be a valuable resource for professional programmers\"\n\nand attributed it to \"You\" (as stated in the first word of the sentence), meaning those who might offer a counterpoint to his point.
