My thoughts as a beginner, is that some questions are poorly written, I guess in some cases because the author doesn't know (or don't care) how to properly write a question which will trigger an answer (and I am guilty of that too when in retrospect I look at some questions I asked).\nOn many subject it help to deconstruct the problem one is facing to solve it, in order to do so having a range of aspects on the questions to fill can help the author to write his questions for instance:\n - describing his own experience in the field of the question\n - describing what have been tried to so far to answer the problem, and what was the effect.\n - describing external reference on the topics that have been studied and the effect on the topic.\n - giving some context around the questions.\nIdeally this set of questions should be write by the experts in the field. then until the users have reach a level of the reputation they should have to answer theses subtopic of their questions.\nThe advantages for teh site is that divided in subtopic, it will be easier to spot the lack of interest of the author, ie instead of having to make sense of unstructured text, it will be semi-structure text (controling the content will be much easier). \nThe advantage for the authors, at least the one new to the field who want to progress it will give them a kind of rudimentary framework to ask themselves first what to do to find the answer. In time one can hope that because they get better answers they progress faster.\nAnd for the ones answering the questions it will ease their work and maybe allow them to find way to answer the questions more efficiently.\nHope it could help."}]}
