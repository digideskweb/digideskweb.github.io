After 7 years the patent in question became public domain and anyone could use it and no one could patent it or anything like it again. You had to have a working, proven, model to get a patent; a idea on a napkin or a sketch of something that could, in theory, do something was not valid. The idea had to be something new and 100% original, you couldn't patent/copyright a common word, shape (I look in disgust at you, apple) or a common color. Unless you could prove the word, shape, color was 100% new.\n\nIn all this there was still some common sense. Really, how many ways can you make a book or a wheel? Regardless of the patent it would enter the public domain, the patent holder lost all their rights to it and anyone could pick it up and use it. This system worked very well! It stopped many crap patents and even the crap ones that wiggled through only got 7 years before becoming public domain. It also helped drive innovation. No one could patent something, sit on it for years doing nothing, and wait  to sue anyone that tried to use it. The 7 year limit also pushed people and companies to invent 100% new things and make as much profit as they could off of it in the next 7 years. This system worked for close to 400 years! \n\nSo what happened? Greed mostly. Companies like Disney that didn't want Mickey falling into public domain, the movie and music industry trying to keep control over what you hear and see, and Monsanto killing small time farmers with genetic patents on grains that they didn't invent but happened to be the first to patent. In reality, most products only have about  7 years of real value anyway. How many of us are still using 7 year old phones, computers, operating systems or other items?  \n \nHere's a simple thought- go back to what worked and let innovation back into the invention process!"}, {"author_name": "Neowizard", "gravatar_hash": "3c29baddd50856a673e476a8f8091a2d", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 20, 2012", "message": "@Anthony\n\nNothing more to add..."}, {"author_name": "rdm", "gravatar_hash": "a59951e9c438c4631cdb23340ff0c640", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 20, 2012", "message": "I spent a few minutes on the new site.\n\nIt's... a bit painful to use, right now.\n\nOne thing that I think would really help is: whenever a patent number is mentioned, if that could be autolinked to the official description of that patent.

The current law changes that to 20 years, but starting from when the patent was file, not when it was granted1. It typically takes *around* three years for a patent to be granted, so in most cases it adds little (and for patents that take longer to be granted, may reduce the life somewhat).\n\nThe Disney extensions were to copyrights, not patents.\n\n---\n\n1 This plugged a whole previously used by the government.

Issued patents are only presumed valid.\n\nTypically, an inventor spends $1000 on a pre-examination search, and a defense litigation team spends about $100,000 to invalidate a patent.

But, like any wiki-type evaluation, the credentials of the evaluators (and their motive) needs to be taken into account, otherwise we again devolve to chaos.  \n\nIn addition to crowd sourcing, gamification techniques need to be deployed to grade and present the analytical material in a unified format.  \n\nThe reliance of examiners on word searches has led sophisticated companies to patent essentially the same thing, but change the words to describe the invention.

Distinguishing software patents from other types  in law not some Gordian Knot that no mind can unravel. \n\nAllegedly, and this is alleged by lawyers if you see what I mean, it would put the US in violation of TRIPS. Sorry, but determining the original 101-ness - the patentable subject matter - of human-crfeated artifacts  is not something legislated by TRIPS. It's adjudicated by Congress.  \n\nIf we want to all get together and make a group effort, then there are more effective ways. \n\nIf software companies simply decided to stop selling into the US market, that would get Congress's attention. In fact, many software companies do decide to do this, but that fact is not widely publicized, not least of all because who wants to be made an example of by vindictive lawyers who sense a threat to their gravy train? Still, it's a aggregate statistic  worth quantifying by motivated researchers. \n\nA real group effort that might make a difference would be for developers to form and join an organization dedicated to obtaining patents from the USPTO and using them to sue Microsoft and Apple and IBM and the other major software-patent-pushers. \n\nEssentially he idea is to form a hive troll organization where members and contributors give away their patent rights to the organization who in turn only uses proceeds from licensing and lawsuit to acquire more patents. \n\nIf academic researchers and the majority of programmers contributed their ideas and we could get enough funding to pay for lawyers until such time as we become self-supporting, then we, and not Microsoft or IBM or Apple would be the most feared patent-wielding organization. \n\nThe accumulated IP- as the CAFC has chosen to define IP- would be enormous. We'd have no reason to sign any kind of \"patent truce\" with any of our targets, since our goal is to kill software patents.\n\nAnd how would this lead to an end of software patents? First, think of the media optics.   How do you think it's going to  play to Congress when the VAST MAJORITY or professional programmers and researchers are all foregoing billions(!)  of dollars in order to try to motivate Congress to do the right thing? Is that a story you think would sell? \n\nSecondly, once Apple / Micorsoft / IBM faced it's upteenth infringement lawsuit from us with no end in site, think their shareholders would start to demand a rethinking of their resistance  to banning software? Think they will be able to sustain the fiction that they're \"creating value\" by software patenting ? \n\n\nThere is nothing pie in the sky about this, as slightly madcap as it might seem.  This can be done; it's what patent trolls do do now in the real world. All that is needed is the organizational and contractual / lawyering skills and some seed money. And a little publicity."}, {"author_name": "hjghjk", "gravatar_hash": "66da23d6b350f34bcc03cf39c8a2e663", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 21, 2012", "message": "Do you imagine how boring is to read someone's *patent rant* written out of boredom?"}, {"author_name": "Bryan", "gravatar_hash": "78018a4bbe5d38ec16ffaf74dc2b6049", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 21, 2012", "message": "This is an intriguing idea, lads.

Louis had it right as well as a couple of others. First, S/W patents were not allowed until the 1980s. This was after the first PCs hit the market (not necessarily talking IBM PC - Apple, Radio Shack and other had PCs out in the market before the IBM PC). Second, it wasn't until the 70s that S/W could even be \"Copyright\"ed. Prior to that, S/W was considered to be a series of mathematical algorithms, which were not allowed to be patented (and still aren't). Also, in the 50s and 60s, much of the source code was made freely available. \n\nIf you stop and think about it, very, very little falls into the categories of \"novel\" and \"non-obvious\" as the computer, in general, is nothing more than an extension of solving a problem (or performing a function) on paper. While there have been a lot of significant S/W advances made over the years, it has primarily been due to advances in H/W. Back in the 50s and 60s, the H/W was insufficient to allow the S/W to perform as it can on today's H/W. Much of the processing back then was done with a combination of H/W, S/W and manual effort. As soon as the H/W became more capable, it becomes \"obvious\" that what was done manually can now be done on a computer and all that is needed is the S/W to make it happen. The argument of not being \"novel\" also follows along those lines. A good case in point is Microsoft Office. Essentially, it is nothing more than automating the typewriter, filing cabinet and sending letters through mail Likewise with Excel - spread sheets used to be done manually. With the advent of the computer, it was one of the first things automated. Flip Charts became \"Presentation\" charts. Data bases have been around since the beginning of commercial use of computers. Different approaches had been developed as a means for storing and accessing data. SQL is one instance that was in the public domain before S/W patents were allowed. \n\nBack in the 70s, the company, for which I worked, had us write \"technical disclosures\" on anything of significance - due the then recent ruling that S/W could be Copyrighted. I wrote a disclosure dealing with Client/Server processing - over a network or within the same H/W. I could probably make a safe guess that there are a few patents based on my ideas from back then, however, it is very unlikely they would be invalidated - 1) I don't have the time to \"thoroughly\" scan the thousands of S/W patents to see if they incorporated my ideas and 2) even if I found one, I do not have the resources to file a suit against the patent holder. One last clarification on my disclosure, not every idea in it was solely my own. It was based on prior art. I was simply advancing the state of the art back then. \n\nOne last point. S/W was allowed to be Copyrighted because it could be made analogous to writing a novel. That made sense, since prior to extending Copyright law to S/W, some companies were taking \"free\" S/W, making a few minor modifications and then selling it (at the expense of the originator). In the 50s and 60s, it was rare for S/W to be sold. Much of it became \"public domain\". Only those companies who wrote their own may have, or not, kept the source out of the public domain for competitive advantage. However, there were many who had no problem sharing their efforts. This was even truer in the early years of the PC. A lot of \"freeware\", \"shareware\" and the like was written back then. The freeware source was always available and. typically, did not even include a Copyright statement. Most shareware, that I viewed, usually had a Copyright statement, but more often than not, it was never filed as \"Copyrighted\". \n\nUnfortunately, too many \"youngsters\" grew up in the PC era and are not aware of the history of computers and S/W development. \n\nPatents NO, Copyrights YES\n\nFor some interesting read on the topic, check out the following: \n\nMark A.
