However, reproducing the huge content existing in SE looks foolish, even having similar well-ruled community looks very hard. Using the SE API to integrate the platform and SE will be very amazing if you introduce the write methods given above.\n\nHope you think about it :)"}, {"author_name": "Alex Lockwood", "gravatar_hash": "ff9bea692e9366d6c6f870a73b3a35e7", "author_url": "http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com", "date": "Sep 04, 2012", "message": "Awesome!

Starting with comments allows us to make really radical fixes if necessary, as comments aren't nearly as important as questions and answers.\n\nFor example, I'd be comfortable (certainly not happy, but comfortable) deleting all the comments posted via a given app.  Questions and answers, not so much.\n\nOnce (and if) the basic ideas in V2.1 have stood up to the test of time expect further write methods, including posting questions and answers."}, {"author_name": "WendiKidd", "gravatar_hash": "5681f9a67cab8b97d0cda310990acccd", "author_url": "http://stackoverflow.com/users/1023783/wendikidd", "date": "Sep 05, 2012", "message": "I wish we could upvote comments to blog posts...
