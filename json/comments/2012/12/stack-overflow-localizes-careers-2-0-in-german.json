Congrats for the good job!\n\nI have a simple question.. which solution are you using actually for text indexing? SQL Server Full-text Search or Lucene.Net?\n\nIf Sql server, are you using FileTable?\n\nI'm building a high performance application and I don't know which technology we'll use.. I was intended to use Solr, but I've found good news about Sql Server FTS.\n\nWhat's the version of your Sql Server database? Have you created a separated database for hold the text and applying the Text Search?"}, {"author_name": "A K M Mokaddim", "gravatar_hash": "e841b2deaeef854e0ab8ec6cdd1ba740", "author_url": "http://shiplu.mokadd.im", "date": "Dec 13, 2012", "message": "So If a German company posts a job will be visible on English version?

Charging \u20ac450 which correspondes to roughly $600 (instead of $350 on the english site) is not really making things a lot easier. And by the way everybody on stackoverflow already proved to be capable of speaking English anyway. If you just want to make more money then simply say it! :( (Love your site by the way)"}]}
