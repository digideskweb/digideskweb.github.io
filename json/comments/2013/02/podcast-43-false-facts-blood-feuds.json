For centuries, <i>mineral rights</i> have been distinct from <i>property rights</i>, which means that the right to the rocks and ores hundreds of feet below your house does not necessarily lie with you, the landowner. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_rights\n\n2) It's not the case that universities and NIH do most productive pharma research. This is an urban legend which continues to circulate for what I guess are ideological reasons.

This is malarkey. \n\nPenguin Australia \u2013 and I got my info directly from the national manager in a fascinating chat we had in the early nineties \u2013 makes all of its profit from about 3% of its catalogue. Most book runs are negative earners. That means each bestselling author\u2019s sales are carrying the poor sales of the other 97%. That\u2019s about 33 to 1. It costs a bomb to print, package, warehouse, transport and merchandise, and creditors don\u2019t like to wait. \n\nSo when publishers pay at 25 to 1 it\u2019s actually pretty generous, and this is why they love reliable bestsellers like Stephen King.\n\nThe situation is actually pretty similar with music labels. If you think about it most bands are utter shite. A recording contract essentially says \u201cHello unemployed arty wanker, here\u2019s an unsecured loan for two years worth of weed, wine and women plus all the pizza you can eat, see what you can come up with.\u201d Occasionally some of them produce something halfway saleable and it has to cover the bad debts of all the other stoners.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not in favour of such toll collectors. The internet and other technological advancements mean that you no longer need a studio or a distribution chain: their services are no longer required. So long and thanks for all the fish. But they aren\u2019t quite the evil gougers people make them out to be."}, {"author_name": "Diederik Hattignh", "gravatar_hash": "1a5cbaad056fbc8550118c334f609440", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 25, 2013", "message": "Erm, hate to bring up the site itself here, but http://blog.stackoverflow.com/category/podcasts/ only has podcast #40.
