The first 10 years was in a larger company in which our small, distributed group of developers regularly had to justify telecommuting to upper management, despite being extremely productive. Eventually we ended up with new management that served up an ultimatum--move near an office or you're fired.  I can't even describe to you how stupid this was, since at least one individual was being told to commute so he could work *by himself* in a small branch office, and the remaining team was still spread over 2 or 3 offices (meaning we communicated electronically anyway). The attitude seemed to be 'If I have to drive in, then so do you,' even where it made no sense whatsoever.\n\nI tried going into the office, but after 10 years telecommuting, I was so miserable in a cube farm with all of its distractions and the extra hours commuting every week that I quit and got a job with a small company that's almost entirely made up of remote developers.

And, yes, remote workers tend to be more productive, call in sick less, etc.\n\nCompanies could save a lot on office space by allowing telecommuting and employees can save on gas and society can save by having less cars on the road and the environment can save by having less pollution.

All of the replacements were fairly new to management and really didn't get any of the tools or needs of remote workers. We also had an upper management push for 'pair programming' where developers would sit at the same desk and/or do sit down/over the shoulder code reviews daily. Upper management pushed this on everyone and did not even consider providing tools or training for remote workers.\n\nSo I also understand the comments about Agile and other practices that have become common lately. They can often be twisted or ignorantly applied in a way that isolates, ignores, or rejects remote workers.\n\nIt was a great experience while it lasted and I had management who understood / supported it.
