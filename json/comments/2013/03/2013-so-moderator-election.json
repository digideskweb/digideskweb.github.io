Why should a user care or select who the moderator is? Does a user know any of the candidates and would he/she be able to make a right decision? My guess is no.

The part I don't look at (well, not much) is the reputation. That's in many ways a function of which tags they are active in, not how much good they are doing. Some tags don't get quite the love they deserve.\n\nThat said, those with a very high reputation are often very well versed in what the spirit of Stack Overflow is, and what role a moderator has. Yet for all that, I think you'll find that the more telling statistics are actually the other ones listed (meta participation, helpful flags). The silly thing is I'd do fairly badly at those things because I don't actively search for things to flag or spend much time on meta, but then again I'm not standing for election. (I just cannot give the commitment without giving up on shepherding my favorite tags, which I do because of what I feel I owe to the community they represent. That's my perspective; you can listen or ignore as you see fit.)\n\nRead the pitches that they put forward. Look at the statistics and history of activity. Make your own mind up on who will be the kind of moderator you most want. Only then vote. Or don't, if none of the candidates convince you.
