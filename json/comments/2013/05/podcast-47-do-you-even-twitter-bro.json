They should be supplementary, never primary.  The question content (title and body) should stand alone without any additional data residing only in tags.   Thus, in a list of titles, all of the pertinent data about a question should be encapsulated in titles alone.  If you need to rely on tags to clarify what the titles are referring to, there's a problem."}, {"author_name": "click_whir", "gravatar_hash": "16d2a8e7909baef0b22dc4f6ebd31be9", "author_url": null, "date": "May 14, 2013", "message": "I was at the event.

Arduino was launched in a space where three very active forums already exist. This was a major challenge for the proposal, which it wasn't able to counter.\n\nAlso, I wouldnt agree that a proposal that goes very quickly through Area 51 is a good sign for the site. It does indicate massive interest, but whether the interest will actually get translated into activity is hard to say. It could be that people are signing up just because its something new and interesting, but not something that they are actually involved in day to day, or intend to participate in."}, {"author_name": "a person", "gravatar_hash": "649e6961e8061fc7bc6f965fd23b1ea8", "author_url": null, "date": "May 15, 2013", "message": "In the middle of the summmer I wish for cooled toilet seats\u2026"}, {"author_name": "Trond", "gravatar_hash": "126f4ec1dee1bdf1a5d1c1b966ac684e", "author_url": null, "date": "May 15, 2013", "message": "I would like to see the map of the office with the hexagon working spaces, please?"}, {"author_name": "Burkhard", "gravatar_hash": "c8c309c19a1a13bb0e5817c1fd9f4493", "author_url": "http://encircledngsBuf", "date": "May 15, 2013", "message": "\"Next topic: do tags belong in titles?
