It is. It's been under way for much longer than the last couple of months though. And you're not the first to rail against it. But the close-mania is something that's always creeping up on SO, and for fairly logical (and probably unavoidable) reasons:\n\nSO is successful, and when something is successful, people want in on it. That means people flock to Meta, apply to become moderators,  and spend more time discussing how SO should be governed, than actually answering questions. In short, people seek influence.\n\nAnd editing/closing is really the best route if you want to have an impact on the site. If you want to be able to say \"I contributed to making SO what it is today\", then closing questions that you perceive as \"noise\" offers much more bang for the buck than tediously writing elaborate answers to questions. SO lets everyone play moderators, and the result of that is that everyone plays moderators. And if you take that trend to the extreme, then SO becomes a site for moderating programming questions, rather than asking and answering them. Simply because it offers a more tangible reward for less effort.\n\nAnother factor, of course, is that programmers, almost by definition, suffer from some degree of OCD. We *want* to sort and organize and remove stuff which doesn't fit. We want structure and rules and order.\n\nAnd that means that our natural inclination is to close questions aggressively. A lot of SO users over time become curators or caretakers or janitors more than anything else, and start tasking themselves with satisfying their OCD and keeping everything tidy and organized and structured.\n\nThat's not to say it is inevitable that SO ends up being the \"closers haven\" that it sometimes seems to be. There's been a big pushback several times in the past, and many senior users still regularly lock horns with trigger-happy moderators over the issue. And as these changes show, many of the \"higher-ups\" are well aware that closing can be a destructive force if left unchecked.\n\nSo yes, the trend you're seeing is real, and there will probably always be a strong current dragging SO towards \"close-mania\" and \"deletionism\". But that there are also people pushing the other way, so the outcome is certainly not given. If you think questions are being wrongly or unjustly closed, then make yourself heard. Discuss it with Meta, with the involved moderators, send an email to the SE staff.\n\n\nOh, about these changes:\n\nSounds excellent. Yeah, I think that is all.\nI disagree that the current system \"worked\", and I disagree that closing questions is what ensured the site was one where \"experts want to be\" (on the contrary, the policy has scared away far too many extremely knowledgeable users).

Don't pretend that someone else doing something you disapprove of makes your marriage worse, or prevents you from getting married.\n\nTry to improve bad questions with editing, or comments, or downvotes if you must.  There should be a <b>really, really low bar</b> for what constitutes an acceptable question.\n\nI actually listened to the SO podcast a while back, and heard the guys talking about deleting something.  One of them said something like \"this doesn't need to be removed, it isn't actually making the internet worse by being there\".  I wish that person knew how SO users were actually implementing site policy.  Questions aren't closed, or answers deleted, only if they make the internet (or this site) worse.  They're deleted for the most nitpicky reasons.  \n\n<b>Too localized</b> - it's virtually impossible for one person to tell who a question will or won't be useful for in the future.\n\n<b>Subjective</b> - so what if there's subjectivity involved?  That's why we have votes for answers.  Let the community democratic process help identify the best answers.\n\n<b>Off-topic</b> - I constantly see questions about software development tools, or sites developers need to use (e.g. iTunes Connect) closed.  Where else is a better place to find objective experts on this stuff?  Software development isn't just about \"for\" loops and thread pools.  Next time your boss tasks you with some software logistics problem, try telling him/her that the request is \"off topic\".\n\n<b>Not showing what you're tried</b> - there's many questions that have very little documentation available, and until you ask it, you won't even know where to begin.  Not saying what you've tried doesn't necessarily mean you're lazy.\n\nThen, there's the fact that most of the questions I see closed are closed by one moderator, or 5 users, that have virtually no rep in the tag in which they're closing.  That's insane.\n\nA question can be viewed by 100 people, upvoted by many of them, and it only takes 5 OCD zealots to close it?  That makes no sense.\n\nThe <b>reopen</b> mechanism is totally broken.  Once a question gets closed by 5 busy bodies, it's really hard to overrule them.  The closed question just isn't going to get the views needed.\n\nSO is a great website, but I really, really, really <b>hate</b> all the censorship (yes, that's what closing is).

I love the graphic because it finally looks at things from the user\u2019s point of view.\n\nReally the only close reason that was a problem was \u201cToo Localized\u201d.\n\n\u201cOff Topic\u201d is the easiest to understand (though even that can be difficult sometimes when you cannot determine whether the question belongs on this site or another one (e.g., SO/Programmers).\n\nEven \u201cNot a Real Question\u201d was pretty clear; it is not difficult to understand that the question/problem simply cannot be understood (especially if you have seen a few such questions).\n\n\u201cNot Constructive\u201d sounds kind of like a personal attack, but even that makes sense (especially if the explanation were worded a little better) once you see a few examples of bad questions like \u201cwhat\u2019s better/faster?\u201d and the like (though even those are often legitimate when talking about performance optimization, simplicity, cost-effectiveness, etc.)\n\nOnly \u201cToo Localized\u201d is confusing, insulting, and frequently misused, even by experienced users and admins. Obviously something like \u201cwhat\u2019s the cheapest\u2026\u201d would fit, but almost every other kind of question could at least be *made* to fit (maybe some sort of auto-conversion-to-chat?)\n\nLike others have pointed out, when someone has a problem and reaches out for help, they don\u2019t care whether it will or could help others (in the future no less), they are trying to get help for their immediate problem. There are plenty of places that people can get help, so turning customers away for such a foolish reason is, well, foolish.\n\nDon\u2019t make Mr. T mad.

How'd that go?\n\nWhy do you want to post your question on Stack Overflow so badly? Is it because Stack Overflow is the best site? Yes, and it's the best because of the very house cleaning you're complaining about.\n\nStack Overflow in particular gets WAY too many posts to just let people post anything they want. It would become just as bad as all those other Q&amp;A sites in a matter of *days*. It has to have a scope, and that scope has to be enforced, or the whole thing would collapse.\n\nIt's good that these improvements are being made so that users will understand why things are happening; we should help new users who are willing to learn to ask better questions so that they can in turn receive better answers.\n\nOn the other hand there are clearly a small percentage of people who are *not* willing to change in even the slightest way, will accept no quality standards or limitations on scope, and get outraged when told that these sites are different that forums where they can post whatever half-formed thought popped into their head. They will not be missed."}]}
