There appear to be real ads by real companies. Great. Here's what worries me: Once Careers.SE becomes really big, the list of jobs will likely be cluttered with job offers of contractors, consultants, freelance agencies (or whatever euphemism you prefer). Now, this isn't about working conditions at these agencies, they may not even be bad. It's about the fact that when you are employed through an agency, your agent tries to find a job position for you, and you likely end up filling a role not suited best for you, to begin with, but suited best for the agency. It's much like having headhunters take care of your job seeking needs; they're actually caring more about their own job seeking needs, with \"good enough\" being all they care about for you.\n\nMy worst job interview was through a headhunter. I had told them I wanted to do development, and they agreed. During the interview, it became clear that it was actually a sales job. Wasted time for the company, wasted time for the headhunter, wasted time for me.\n\nI got all my gigs by sending my own resume directly to the company's very own HR departments. It's a live and direct transmission, and the channel has a great signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nStack Exchange is all about a good signal strength and the lowest possible noise. Please make sure this will be your one main goal for careers.SE, too. Otherwise, it'll be just another broken job site where you find one real job offer among 20 vague blah-blahs of shiny contracting companies."}]}
