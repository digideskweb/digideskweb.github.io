Joel mentioned that he was teaming up with somebody named Jeff Atwood to make some sort of Q&amp;A site, but I didn't think much of it at the time.\n\nBy September 15, I'd seen enough to know that this new site might be worth a look. I poked my head in, looked around a bit, and closed it. As a young developer, I knew that everyone there was so much smarter than me that I could never contribute anything.\n\nFor some reason I came back the next day. I saw a question that I'd just had to solve for myself, so I posted my solution. And somebody upvoted it. And the number next to my name went from 1 to 11. <i>Whoa.</i>\n\nI answered two more questions in the next half hour, then closed the tab, thinking it was pretty neat and maybe I should try again tomorrow. The next day I logged on again and found that one of my answers had been upvoted twice during the night. This was getting exciting! I posted another answer that day but it didn't get any votes.\n\nOn the third day I found a Java trivia question that I happened to know the answer to, and somehow no one else had posted the answer yet (a good solid three minutes after it had been asked). I posted the answer and it was accepted almost immediately! And it was upvoted! Over and over again! In all, I posted four answers that day and hit the reputation cap. And that, as they say, was that.\n\nAs a bit of a neat freak, I was very glad to reach 2000 reputation so I could fix all the horrible things other people wrote (its really an eyesore when apostrophe is used outside it's correct place). After the 10k tools were created in early 2009, I started spending a good portion of my SO time voting to close or delete questions that didn't belong. When Meta Stack Overflow began in June, I was there to navel-gaze and post jokes at inappropriate times (I still miss you, TheTXI and Pesto!). And a year after that, I managed to fail my way into a moderator post.\n\nIn the five years since Stack Overflow opened, I hope I've saved people's bacon as many times as they saved mine.

I was tired of seeing useful information buried under nondescript questions, and hoped that SO would become a sort of *wiki-editable forum* to help alleviate this problem. \n\nSo I answered a few questions and posted a few of my own, edited a lot of stuff (hopefully for the better), and spent way too much time arguing about the behavior of the software itself. And this ended up having a few unexpected benefits:\n\n<ul><li><b>I got better at discussion.</b> For something that is explicitly <i>not</i> a discussion platform, SO has a lot to teach about constructive discussion. An awful lot of Internet discussion mediums implicitly encourage strategies that seek only to elicit responses, via appeals to prejudice and emotion, or to wear the other participants down in order to have the last word... Conveying useful information often happens as an afterthought (if at all). The notion that a <i>really useful</i> post is one that gets very few responses (if any) took me a long time to latch onto, but it is one that's improved my ability to write far outside of Stack Exchange.</li>\n<li><b>I got a lot better at editing.</b> Modifying someone else's work is deceptively hard: done right, it's often more like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening\" rel=\"nofollow\">active listening</a> than copy editing. A great edit can change the entire perception of a post without losing sight of the original author's intent, a skill I've come to see as incredibly valuable and worth striving to obtain.</li>\n<li><b>I became more patient.</b> Nothing beats seeing an up-vote - or accept checkmark - on an answer written months or years ago to remind you that there are folks still out there struggling with the same problems that once frustrated you, and that it's worth spending the time to post this stuff even if the person you're replying to seems to have disappeared without a trace. And seeing a proposed feature implemented months or years after you proposed it is a great motivator to keep suggesting improvements - even when it seems like no one is listening a lot of the time.</li></ul>\n\nFor something I expected to be little more than a useful novelty, I've learned a heck of a lot from y'all.

It did not begin 5 years ago with stack exchange. 5 years ago I was a student studying computer science aspiring to complete a bachelors and start a company.\n\nIn fall 2010 I completed my degree work and began to develop, realizing that starting a company would probably require more capitol than I had. I returned to assist in a company I had worked with over the past decade. \n\nWith the goal of creating a service I began developing with the same technology that stack exchange was built with. While developing I came across various exceptions that I drew a blank over. I searched for the text of the error and got help at stackoverflow. At first, I did not even notice that the majority of the links I clicked were stackoverflow because I was also looking at other resources online. I also bought a lot of books. Any time I was considering something new, I would buy a book. I guess that was just instilled in me from being \"classically\" trained.\n\nAfter a few months of noticing a pattern of visiting stackoverflow I posted my first question. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8467172/post-redirect-get-hide-url-parameters . Okay, so it was a rudimentary issue. Since then I have answered over 1,000 questions. I have learned more by answering questions than I have asking them, because the information is so thoroughly scrubbed it forces you to be accurate.\n\nSome of my favorite moments on stackoverflow have been from users pointing me to official documentation that I had not been aware of. For example, the ecma-international.org site for the real breakdown of javascript.\n\nThe highlight of being at stackoverflow has been the other users. People who think to take time from their busy lives to break down problems other people are having - taking their miracle on a chalk board to an tangible implementation.\n\nMost of all, I will never forget getting to chat with Jon Skeet in the C# chat room.

I would slowly pick up ideas here and there, employ a cute little class or a technique of some kind, but I was still functioning as little more than a script-kiddie. Not surprisingly, my \"career\" and the attendant revenues that it generated, were meager: enough to live on, but not really enough to thrive.\n\nI began a self-study of Zend Framework and Stack Overflow emerged as an important vehicle in that study, at first primarily as a source of answers to my questions. But since I have always judged the firmness of my understanding by my ability to explain it, I slowly started answering questions where I could.\n\nIt was hard at first. I knew so little, that each answer I submitted required a lot research. Further, this was a public forum and I was desperately afraid that it would turn it into a megaphone for my incompetence, for my inexperience, for my stupidity. But getting \"out there\" and risking the embarrassment of being wrong (while simultaneously forcing me to raise my game so as not be wrong, at least very often) were critical steps in my progress as a professional developer.\n\nOver time, I increased in confidence and accumulated some reputation. The profile that I was able to establish on Stack Overflow was exactly the kind of self-marketing with which I was comfortable. I didn't really see myself glad-handing at networking events to drum up business, handing out business cards, and claiming the be the \"third largest developer of information technnology solution for small and medium enterprises in the greater tri-state area\" or some such thing. Between the small corpus of writing I had established on SO and the reputation that attached thereto, anyone who needed to know was able to get a sense of what I was about without me having to puff it up into a tangled jumble of self-promotional Dilbert-speak.\n\nThe opportunities that have since come to me - working on great projects with the awesome team at Diamond Web Services in Los Angeles; consulting on some startups; serving as technical reviewer on a book - all came in some part from this public profile. \n\nBut most of all, because these opportunities enhanced my career/revenue profile, my children now have a father who - while still busy and still overwhelmed with the always-present, absolutely-crushing responsibility of parenting - is now able to at least provide for them and who can be there for them with less stress about making next month's rent.\n\nI think it's fair to say that my life and the lives of my children are significantly improved in no small part due to Stack Overflow.\n\nMany thanks!"}, {"author_name": "Nikhil", "gravatar_hash": "8395ddac6b49ada12c4d8034e5ebfc66", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 16, 2013", "message": "I started off my career on 15th of Sept, 2010.

And of course, when you get that answer you're looking for, there's that wonderful flood of relief, not to mention a facepalm when you discover how obvious the solution is ;)\n\nAnswering questions is also a awesome. The fake points are bonus, and allow you to reflect on how helpful you've managed to be, but the true joy is when you know you've been able to help. Even if my answer isn't accepted, an upvote and a comment on how I might have helped somebody really makes it worthwhile. Even if I don't know them in the slightest, knowing that I've helped somebody with a problem just feels good and rewarding.\n\nStack Overflow, and indeed Stack Exchange as a whole, is a truly great thing.

I found a room with a chat bot and started playing with it. For some reason, I gave my (encoded) phone number to the bot not thinking too much about it. \n\nAfter two weeks, I got a message on my cell phone from \"the bot\". I couldn't believe someone had seen my number. We kept messaging back and forth until I found out that the sender lived only 60km away. So we decided to meet. When we met, I found out that we were around the same age and we really got along. Unfortunately, I had to leave the next day to Mexico, my home country. Later that year we met again and started officially dating. \n\nI started going into the Javascript chatroom. I've met wonderful people there including the creator of the bot (Zirak) who was the one that told my boyfriend (copy) about the message with my phone number.

I was a MBA in finance with no prior experience in programming. It took me quite a lot of time to decide that I could never work in finance industry. I used to be a hobby-programmer and so I took a risk. I joined one startup firm as an Android developer. They gave me chance to show my skills(Which I didn't have). They gave me a programming problem to find a solution, probably to confirm if I know something about coding. I couldn't solve it and since it was late, they gave me another day to solve it. I was feeling a bit shaky about the decision I took. I was thinking that it was a bad decision. Next day I put the problem on google, clicked on the first result, it was a stackoverflow question page. It helped me to answer part of the problem, so I chose to signup and search for other parts of the problem. There were a lot of good answers and more than 2-3 methods to solve my problem. I solved it, made a build and I got the job.\nAfter making more than 50 apps/games and countless versions and plugins in more than 10 programming languages since then, I can say that I am proud of my decision and consider Stackoverflow as my greatest supporter and mentor. I think it's just a concidence that I am thinking to start my own development studio and today I bought the domain for the website as a first step.\nI could never thank enough to Stackoverflow for the help, support, motivation it provided to make me what I am now.

Since I have no WiFi in the train, I have to use try-and-error whenever I encounter a problem during the ride. One day I used to learn how to make WPF applications with XAML, when I noticed that all my buttons' icons appeared to be blurry. I fumbled around with sizing, different file formats, rendering options and so on, but since I couldn't find a solution, I focused on other problems, since there is more important work to do than button icons.\n\nI wrote several dozens of WPF applications, some small, some large, some for testing, some made for productive use. They all had blurry icons in common.\n\nAnd then, one late night, I figured that I couldn't possibly be the only one in the world having this issue. I googled my problem and Stack Overflow showed up as first result. The solution given in the the top answer by votes was to add a specific property to the main window. I tried it and *SWOOSH* everything looked brilliant. Although that answer had already a lot of votes up, I wanted to thank whoever had solved one of my most annoying problems.\n\nThat's why I registered, and since I've used Stack Overflow a lot to get my work done without hours of try-and-error. If you can't figure it out within 3 different approaches, why not simply get inspired by how other people solved the problem? Often I find even better code than what I'd produce. So you cannot only use Stack Overflow to get answers, reading a lot of questions and answers here can actually improve your coding style. That's why I love the site so much.\n\nThe only downside of it is that there is barely a question that 1) I can answer 2) that's not perfectly answered already or 3) that's not considered to be off topic by others. On the other side all of my questions seem to be so difficult to solve that none of them have been answered yet except for \"you can't do that\" or worse workarounds than what I had gotten to whilst my question was asked and not answered to yet. I hope, one day I'll be good and fast enough to be one of the guys to answer other people's questions."}, {"author_name": "sylvain courcoux", "gravatar_hash": "220c6d21266adce4005fdd8a72c4927d", "author_url": null, "date": "Sep 19, 2013", "message": "Stackoverflow made it possible for me to learn programming and build my  own software!

Yes! StackOverflow was not ranked as highly as it is now in search results. I believe after reading a couple of answers which helped me out of a pinch, I came across [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/953704/117870) which had an answer quite different from the acceptable/standard procedure. I put my answer in there and was gone for six months when my visits began getting kind of regular and I got my second badge which, rather sadly, was a tubleweed badge.\n\nI asked a couple of questions and answered a few. It had to take an [unexpected bounty](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3311975/117870) to bring the site into my focus. Ever since, the name of the site is not on only bookmarked on all my browsers, it is etched firmly in my memory!\n\nMy contribution to this site has reduced now to editing questions and answers mainly but whenever possible I do make time to answer questions. After all, there is no better way of learning than by teaching. :)\n\nI would like to thank the wonderful people who created this site and the whole Stack Exchange group of sites for the wonderful work done. Kudos to the moderators who in their own small ways keep the site clean. And not least, I greatly appreciate the contributions of people like Eric Lippert, Jon Skeet, Mark Gravell and Hans Passant whose in-depth answers (and sometimes questions) give us the underlings a lot to aspire to.\n\nLet's keep up the good work!
