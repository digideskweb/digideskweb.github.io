The blue on black logo also makes the logo less discernible. So, if one of the goals of the black bar was to increase the visibility of the logo, has that been achieved? Another way to look at the issue: what if IBM put their famous logo in blue text on a black background: would it fly?\n\nFrom an end user perspective, though, the most disconcerting feature of the black bar is how distracting it is. The level of distraction depends on the design of the sub-site in which the black bar sits. For instance, the black bar is not so glaring on the User Experience site, because the black bar sits above a large blue banner. But on a site like stackoverflow, the black bar immediately hits the white of the canvas, thereby calling more attention to the bar itself (as a rectangular black object, not as a content holder). If users are being distracted by a #212121 rectangle, the issue needs to be resolved. \n\nPrior comments have already mentioned Google's short-lived use of the black bar. I am sure there are those of us who will get used to dealing with the black bar, but I am also sure there are many stackexchange users who will be happy once the black bar disappears, just as they were happy after Google abandoned its own black bar experiment."}, {"author_name": "tinstaafl", "gravatar_hash": "52d39acf2c17782acd55688ce69c46d4", "author_url": null, "date": "Dec 04, 2013", "message": "Most ridiculous thing I've seen in a long time.
