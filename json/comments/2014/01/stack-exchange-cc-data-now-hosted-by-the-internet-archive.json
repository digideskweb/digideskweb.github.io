So trying to add restrictions doesn't make it stop being CC-BY-SA 3.0, it just makes the added restrictions void.\n\n(Here I'm assuming you haven't drafted your own actual license just based on the CC licenses. Then I don't know what happens... I suspect that there is a misrepresentation of license or trademark abuse thing involved if you claim your homebrewed license is Creative Commons.)\n\nThat said, the bit in the post about \"nofollow\" &amp;c seems to be a request phrased as a \"should\" (not a \"must\"), which I believe has the force of \"playing nice\" rather than law, and that's OK."}, {"author_name": "Franck Dernoncourt", "gravatar_hash": "5a151713b9eae8dc566f5957acee3475", "author_url": "http://francky.me", "date": "Jan 24, 2014", "message": "Great to have the dumps, but some comments: in addition to the unrealistic, ironic and maybe unlawful nofollow rule, linking back to the original source question or answer is pretty difficult when the latter has been deleted, which happens quite frequently.

I'm not a lawyer and don't know how you finagle it, but to require nofollow links to StackExchange when StackExchange arbitrarily adds nofollow on most legitimate links which are citations/references to other content which may itself have equal attribution requirements is not reasonable. StackExchange does not it self \"keep with the spirit of sharing and proper attribution\" and therefore sets a poor example for the community regarding proper attribution.

Not doing so will encourage people to push their link(s) everywhere they see fit, even if said links add hardly anything to the post. Another major example of a site that uses cc-by-sa, Wikipedia, simply adds nofollow to any external website that is not an so-called 'interwiki-link'.\n\nAlso remember that you may copy entire pages from SE, edit them if you like and publish them as your own, as long as you properly attribute it, while for other sites that are under regular copyright, you are only allowed to cite part of a page. If you copy an entire page and call that 'a citation', you risk a lawsuit... You are not allowed to rewrite portions of such citations to make the text to fit your purposes better.\n\nOr to put it in other words: Citation is something different than what license content is under.
