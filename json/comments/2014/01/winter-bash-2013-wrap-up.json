I can identify at least 10 Don Draper hats. There were 3 on SO and 1 on Unix when I was trying to figure the hat out circa December 28. I got 2 yesterday, one on Scifi and one on RPG. After that I know of 3 more on EL&amp;U and 1 more on Unix yesterday. There could be others as well. That gives at least 10 hats among 9 users. Most of the ones after mine were pretty late, probably in the last hour of the day. (I know for a fact that a lot of other top users had no idea the hat even existed until I got it, and I had intended to time it late enough that follow-ups wouldn't be possible but missed the mark a bit.) I'm pretty sure the correct number is somewhere between 10 and 15. Anyway, Don Draper is still clearly the rarest hat, but it's not quite as rare as the numbers above would indicate.\n\nAlso, while I'm here, I'd like to thank SE for setting this up and everyone who participated for making it fun. Here's to hoping that Winter Bash 2014 will be as fun as this year was."}, {"author_name": "Grishu", "gravatar_hash": "713473bb323306200abfdd5bcd96f80d", "author_url": "http://www.github.com", "date": "Jan 03, 2014", "message": "I wish it would have been kept for some more time. :("}, {"author_name": "Michael Calkins", "gravatar_hash": "af9df0175a70903be287a66a4609e3ad", "author_url": "http://clouddueling.com", "date": "Jan 03, 2014", "message": "I think you guys should bring them back I thought they were really cool!!"}, {"author_name": "Sathiya Kumar", "gravatar_hash": "c4e7dc3de111a898dfc067b22a71a446", "author_url": "http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/users/28169/sathiya-kumar", "date": "Jan 03, 2014", "message": "I love all my 10 hats :) I really miss my hats :( :( Hope I'll get more hat next year :) :)"}, {"author_name": "Meat Trademark", "gravatar_hash": "588f6fb899fd03dbc9d5bdf3939a435b", "author_url": "http://meattrademark.blogspot.com/", "date": "Jan 04, 2014", "message": "I ended up with 26 total and **loved** it.
