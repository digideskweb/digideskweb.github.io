I think this idea can be integrated into the point system of SO. Say there is a Japanese (or whatever non-English language) speaker J who understands English only a little finds a thread which he/she wants to understand in detail. Then J can flag the best answer as 'translation wanted: to Japanese' so that a translator can come along, translate the answer, and earn points. J can then click on 'view in a different language,' choose Japanese, and read the answer in his/her native language. If the point system can motivate users to answer questions, I don't see why the system won't motivate them to translate. \n\nI'm not sure how realistic this is, or how well this will make SO more inclusive, but it is a possible solution to make SO non-English-speaker-friendly without decentralizing the SO community.

Non-English speaking users will not have access to the same question and answers as English speaking users and vice-versa.

Even the keywords for most languages are in English and I don't expect this to ever change. Have you ever encountered Chinese C or Pascal? Even the program comments, which can be written in any language is still written in English. Besides, I will take a guess and say that most of the content on SO is code snippets with very little written descriptions.\n\nStill, I think something should be done. Your best bet is to just have a translation button embedded in SO answer box from Google or some other translation service. It will make it easier for non-English speakers to translate text without cutting and pasting into a translation site or program. This can be done in any language. It may not be the best translation, but it certainly helps. Programmers are also fairly good at parsing out the meaning of an awkwardly constructed sentence if they have to.\n\nIf a non-English speaking user wants to answer a question, they can use a translation service like Google Translate embedded in SO.

See my point? I'm know that I'm exaggerating, but even a single translation step is pretty dangerous (My blog have a translation Widget and it completely butchers my text).\n\nOne more point, several users (like me) are sharing links to answers and questions from SO on SO-PT.

It allows a lot of words-shortcuts and abbreviations, a lot of acronyms are used (even if lol was translated in FR, we do not have TL;DR for instance).\n\nI realized in my engineer school, where the average english level was really bad, that you can actually learn (good) programming only speaking French.

I wasn't even searching for French websites (google gives me EN results, not FR).\nI looked at my mates like martians when I was being answered \"Why would we learn English ? We live and work in France, working with and for French companies. What's your point apart pure knowledge?\". Of course, they didn't already work abroad or for a bigger (int'l) corporation, where my point lies, but they got theirs (point).\nMoreover the average English level of French people is bad, and you see this in all countries with Latin/mediterranean roots (for example, FR/SP/IT/PT/... people speak less english than DE/CH/NL/SE/...). Let's face it, we are lazy people when it comes to learning foreign languages (a 10 year old study showed FR people were the biggest pot smokers in Europe but the last ones to be able to speak English.

The english level on websites nowadays is way worst than it was, and if I get it, native english readers should feel it even more. I blame no one, I'm an offender, but that's sad.\n\nI'll eventually end up with this, language bridges must be made, so knowledge stays universal forever.

There is no other way. We need to prompt our leaders to choose an official world auxiliary language, a language to be taught in addition to local or national languages in each school of the world. It could be an existing language like English, a constructed one like Esperanto--whatever will get agreement.

Yet it would be an economic, scientific, and cultural boon to all countries.\n\nCountries such as China and Israel chose a language and were able to achieve greater national unity and consequently development within themselves by requiring by law that a national standard language be taught to their people where one did not exist previously.\n\nIt is time that we of whatever country recognize that \"our people\" ought to go a step beyond our national unity to the whole world, and we developers ought to be at the forefront of an understanding and promotion of this, given that so many of our collectively shared coding contributions or sharing of knowledge of which we are all benefactors comes from people from diverse backgrounds already.\n\nHaving a common language available because of early education in a common international language around the world, will not be preventing healthy diversity, it would eliminate the ultimately needless forks of such sites as this (though again, I'm not disputing the need for such a site right now pending such an international agreement and dissemination of the common language).

People who do not take the time to learn the last 10,000 years of history will always make the same mistakes.  It is the cycle of things.  If it weren't so sad, it would be comical.  So begins the self-inflicted downfall of Stack Overflow.  It will take about a week for a new site to replace Stack Overflow.\n\nComputer Science is an amalgamation of only three things:\n\n1. Conditional branching\n2. Memory allocation\n3. Basic arithmetic\n\nThat's it.  Yes, really, that's it.  Everything else is an algorithm, and requires YEARS of diligent study and practice, IN ENGLISH.  Learning to become a real programmer takes as much study to become a real doctor.  Medical schools do not teach Organic Chemistry in non-English, and America does not accept medical degrees from non-English speaking countries.\n\nBut let's take the devil's advocate: if you think cowboy coding (I call it meth-lab programming) is perfectly fine, then the flip-side argument is that, based on the three elements mentioned above, the only English one would need to learn to program are the following words:\n\ndo\nwhile\nfor\ngoto (yes, goto - it's just a jump assembly instruction)\nvar\nmalloc\nand the arithmetic operators, which are language independent.\n\nA whooping six words in English.  If someone can't learn six words in English, he should not be programming.\n\nAnother thought - China did not ask for our entire manufacturing industry.  We westerners just gave it to them.  For free.  Now programming.  For all our intelligence, we western people are very naive and stupid.  So now we will give them the SQL language without requiring them to understand the algorithm of 'data-integrity'.  Fabulous.  Great idea.  Now we can have cheap software to go with our cheap blenders and brooms.  Westerners are the only ones willing to completely destroy the livelihoods our fathers built for us, for no reason at all.  And we pay for it, to boot.  No other culture acts this way.  Not one.\n\nAnother thing: for Westerners to suggest it is \"our\" job to enlighten the rest of the world is to suggest the other world's cultures are incapable of doing it themselves.  That seems to me to be teetering on the big 'R' word.  And don't kid yourselves and pretend that's not what you're doing.  You are in fact 'Alexander-the-Great'ing, period.  There is nothing stopping any other culture from creating their own Stack Overflow.  It's just an electronic bulletin board.\n\nOne other thought to consider: communism always follows capitalism.  This is the universal life and death of things in our world.  Stack Overflow exists in it's current state because people stumbled upon it and together aggregated it, invisible-hand style.\n\nSo now you are going to \"force\" a new incarnation of something that was made great by capitalism... hmmm... haven't seen this before...  Stack Overflow is a B. Fuller geodesic dome, held together by English.  Nobody forced it.  Just watch what happens - taking away English from Stack Overflow is like taking away the coal from a fire to get more energy.\n\nRemember, \"diversity\" is literally the opposite of \"unity\", both in parlance and in practice.

Before that we were just a colony or a \"country for few\". Why does that matter? This history had a great impact on our education and english is still a privilege of few (it doesn't reach 5% of the population). The english level you have to reach to start understanding the required technical language for programming is also a challenge for most of the people (probably less than 1% of the population).\n\nNow some may argue that if they want to be a developer, then this person should just learn english first. Well, I'm not sure people would be motivated to study for a year or so in order to just try something they might not even like. Even kids should have the opportunity to learn to code without taking such a big step and that's what happens in other countries.\n\nAt last, I have to say: I'm sorry for my english, because even though I use it every day reading, writing and studying I don't have many opportunities to use it with people I meet because we are a very isolated country when it comes to language. Take Europe for example. Every country there is the size of one of our regions and full of foreigners. English is commonplace, a language every one must know to communicate with their neighbours. Or take India, that is in a similar situation to ours but has english as official language. All our neighbours speak spanish with whom we can communicate basically in portuguese but we almost never have contact with them.\n\nSo that is our situation. Not a bad or good one, but different.\nI totally agree we should have a language known worldwide and I don't have much problems that the chosen one is english (even though many others have, not without reasons, for instance our 20 years long dictatorship which was organised and financed by the CIA - you probably don't know that). Anyway we are far away from dominating a second language and we can choose: segregate or give the opportunity to all. \n\nThat is why I agree with this initiative and by now you should have realised why it's got some risk of failure, given our small number of people involved with technology, which may prefer to answer and make questions in the global community rather in the BR version."}, {"author_name": "ninjalj", "gravatar_hash": "3ea8a6cc427e284e0bcf6e6008638b79", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 17, 2014", "message": "As Tom Christiansen put it at http://stackoverflow.com/a/4839551/371250:\n\n\"This idea that English and ASCII were good enough for Grandpa in Iowa so it better be good enough for Rajesh in New Delhi, let alone for Akira in Kyoto, is deeply troubling.
