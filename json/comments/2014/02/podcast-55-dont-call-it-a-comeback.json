We allow Purim Torah only during a certain 2-week period of the year, after which we close all the Purim Torah questions. In addition, all Purim Torah questions have a prominent disclaimer in the question body that points back to the Purim Torah policy. All together, this policy allows for some fun silliness for a couple weeks and effectively quarantines it from the serious content that makes up our usual fare.\n\nhttp://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/797/purim-torah-policy-allowed-but-regulated\n\nAs it happens, Purim Torah season is coming in just a few days, starting Saturday night, March 1. Also, about a week later, we're going to be coming out with a printable Purim book based on content from Mi Yodeya, about 1/3 of which will be past Purim Torah Q&amp;A. Check http://s.tk/miyodeya during the week beginning March 10."}, {"author_name": "Simon Whitehead", "gravatar_hash": "d15c5670dad6eab33c0cccbd7f6b2669", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 26, 2014", "message": "I don't know if this applies to everyone.. but I can certainly explain hit explains the \"50% google -&gt; SO answer\" scepticism from my point of view.\n\nI have a dedicated SO tab while I'm at work and use it to answer questions.
