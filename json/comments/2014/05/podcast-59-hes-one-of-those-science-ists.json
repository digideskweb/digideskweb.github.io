It's not just programming. I'm active on the stats.stackoverflow site and we get questions like that *all the time* (peoples who aren't statisticians and have to do some statistics). And you know what? It's OK. That's what all these sites are about: sometimes, in the course of your job, prototyping with ideas forces you to use skills you don't master. Often, if the prototype works, you'll get more resources. But as a first step you are trying to patch different parts and need good quality (expert level) knowledge you don't have time to acquire right now. This site gives you that independence and makes the world a better place for it. For the rest, people have conscience and everybody is good at *something*. I'm trying to manage my karma by helping peoples in when I can, but I ain't gonna answer/ask many HQ programming questions. \n\nBtw,  listening to your comments about the results of these basic stats ('A/B testing') you mention in the podcast, I suggest you ask about *that* on the stat stack-exchange once.

In other words, when hard questions are asked, those without adequate knowledge or ability will rarely be able to answer them. Hard questions can look like visual noise to some. Advanced customers looking for thoughtful questions need a way to shape their experience (to lessen their dumping on the casual customer).\n\n**But, as with behavioral metrics, education metrics should not dominate the user experience.** The profile metrics pie needs to be sliced up to reflect the traits of the customer: subject matter, ability on that subject, education/training, difficulty of questions desired to be seen ... all of it needs to be the customer's choice based on who they are personally. Yes, I understand their is a tagging system, but that is a passive way of streaming questions towards a customer (you have to wait until they do something). Letting a diverse, yet meaningful, profile help shape question streams before the customer does anything is an active way to shape question streams, give the customer more control, and make the customer happy. There needs to be slider bars to adjust levels! No slider bars, well it won't look as nice. :-) That way, the customer can choose if education matters of not to them.\n\n*Groups* help form bonds. If the owner of this site want to improve the tone they should allow grouping. Also, the notion of reputation needs to be expanded. If you are rude to someone, that person should be able to lower your reputation! Alternatively, create another status called altruism. This way, customer can filter people out who care more about rules and points than helping someone.\n\nBetter question naming may be necessary on Stack Overflow, too. Perhaps there should be a *mandatory order of elements* for each question: programming language(s), database (if any), and general subject. However, constrain the customer created part of the question so as to spark curiosity.

Dropping views for negatively voted posts is a nice idea, but who is going to clean that up, if nobody sees it?  The automated processes?  I'm fine with that, if it happens in a timely manner (30 days is not timely, and low-rep users answer and upvote in the meantime).\n\nCreating canonical question/answer pairs to close all the trivial questions as duplicates of?  I'm OK with that, too, I guess, although it's going to take awhile for that to have any effect.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I haven't listened to the podcast (yet)."}, {"author_name": "Robert Harvey", "gravatar_hash": "1233ec65168f4aae4d939ae8fe6cde1e", "author_url": null, "date": "Jun 01, 2014", "message": "In other news, it would be nice if the markdown formatting worked consistenly **everywhere.**\n\n<blockquote>Learn2HTML, n00b! --Ed.</blockquote>"}, {"author_name": "pita piper", "gravatar_hash": "9234abd1323f6a286f37b7b55ca98968", "author_url": null, "date": "Jun 01, 2014", "message": "First - the recaptchas are completely past Ridiculous. I had to click 30 to 40 times to find one that looked even close to guessable. Then I had to do it another 20 times 'cause apparently my brain and eyes are not equal to ANY of the challenges. Really?

But the audio challenges are just as messed up. \n\nSecondly - I want to say that I also despise the bullying from high status users. I see it over and over, especially in closing questions that are in fact VERY interesting and relevant to many people, or in aggressively down voting answers that suggest alternative methods for doing something. \n\nI'm not talking about stupid answers (\"use linux\" \"use active directory\" \"use silverlight\" \"switch to apple\" \"you don't know enough to ask the right question\" and the rest of the useless baiting that passes as intellect) but about people suggesting or asking about alternate tools or ways to get things done, be it an algorithm or an alternate view point.  \n\nThe proprietors of this site would do well to realize that they will face the exact same struggles that faced slashdot, digg, reddit and all the other techy social media sites. One of the biggest problems that repeatedly bites site owners in the ass is that the people who hang out here all day handing out up and down votes and dispensing advice are seldom representative of the remaining users.\n\nIt's always easier to pass off administration of a site to the people who hang around all day and work for free, but it also invariably gives those same people the impression that they're running a private club and can chase off anyone who isn't just like them.\n\nSame for the duplicates. Close them to your hearts content, but I often see people asking for information that is NOT the same as the questions they are being referred to as dupes. And yet, rather than taking advantage of this to work magic with bayesian indexing voodoo, SE is more interested in pruning their data set.\n\nStats are hard. Psychology is hard.

It's similar to a corporate culture in a large corporation and this so-called culture is steered by upper management. For example, the employees quickly learn what is acceptable behavior and what is not.  Of course, they also learn what gets rewarded and what doesn't--sometimes creating an unwritten code of ethics.  \nWith recent reports that hiring managers are looking at Stack Overflow ratings as a judge of prior experience and proof of frequent involvement in the programming community and ongoing projects, I should be obvious that jobseekers are going to stop at nothing to get what they need to get hired.  This leads to what people complain about, which are tons of lousy and weak questions, simply designed for a friend or pal to answer and gain easy points, without regard to the culture of the forum or concern over it.  This problem tends to lower the grade of the site. There are over a million unanswered difficult questions that seem so complicated, one wonders who in their right mind is going to devote all that time (for free) answering them.  \nIt seems by the rumblings of the site's senior members, that they easily become annoyed by receiving notices of activity on their 6 year old posts (mentioned in podcast).  It sounds more than a bit jaded.  They undoubtedly feel that they have put in their time and we're not going to get much more out of them, unless the posting just happens to suit their ever-more stringent set of 'must haves' to qualify for a moment of their time.   Obviously, no site can continue without nurturing an incoming field of hungry inexperienced programmers, likely with more questions than answers. \n Facebook tried having a 'thumbs down' button,  but they quickly got rid of it because it created way too much ill will and negativity.   I think on SO, the same thing is happening--leading to a sense of being squashed by the powers on the top, who have thousands of down votes to burn, who have what feels like a heavy hand, quickly evaporating whatever hard work went into asking a question or answering. \nOne suggestion, surely to not be appreciated by the 20,000 + crowd, would be to require people over a certain threshold to be more involved helping the new programmers and being supportive, by contributing to a required amount of questions or lose points.  One could easily see that the site is being supported by the newer members and those still trying to reach their points goal by answering, so I see motivating the jaded 20K+ crowd to work a little harder at not bashing newbys with unwarranted down votes and belittling comments, for not having done enough 'research' ."}, {"author_name": "aaron burns", "gravatar_hash": "2e79089faf35c6ada7e35cffd3d45234", "author_url": null, "date": "Jun 20, 2014", "message": "Here just another voice saying that SO has to many high rep members acting like little napoleons.
