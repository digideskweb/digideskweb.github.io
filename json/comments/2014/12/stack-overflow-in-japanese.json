We accept no responsibility for any consequences of poor machine translation\". \n\nThen I can look at the dodgy machine translations. Most will be irrelevant, wading through will be hard work, and there will be some silly ones where technical terms get translated, but if just one contains the insight I'm looking for, it'll be time well spent. \n\nI can then answer my own question in my own language, and BOOM - suddenly we've got quality content in both languages.\n\nFar from pushing content out of the SO family, we're taking expertise that currently lives on Japanese (and Brazilian, etc etc) forums, and making it more accessible to SO users. \n\nThere's work involved - but that's fine, because the person who needs to do that work (the person who asked the question) has the motivation to do it."}, {"author_name": "Hsin Desu", "gravatar_hash": "e0b1f01fe79c7249823c962f95b202bb", "author_url": null, "date": "Dec 16, 2014", "message": "@Tsahi, it is a ridiculous assumption to say that a one needs to learn English in order to be a good programmer.

You on the other hand bring some highly controversial arguments that I can't support or agree with.\n\nAs for the 'superficial issues', I don't see how they are superficial. On the other hand the arguments of the opposers seem to be the ones bringing superficial arguments like fragmentation and that every decent programmer needs to know English (how is that one even an argument worth considering?).\n\nI've written enough wall of text comments here already and don't really want to write a long essay, so just look at the feedback people gave on the hiring thread for the Spanish community manager, it's really mostly positive. https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/271998/fluent-in-spanish-were-hiring-a-community-manager-for-a-spanish-stack-overflow#comment97680_272052\n\nAs for everyone learning English. I'm in support of everyone learning English in school and being able to understand it, but forcing people to speak it? Hell no. Also think about usability, some people even though they can read and write English without any problems prefer to ask questions in their native language. English just doesn't feel comfortable for them.\n\nLet's bring Yukihiro Matsumoto (also known as Matz, he's the inventor of Ruby) and Ruby as an example. Matz knows English and has given several talks in English but yet he still got his programming blog in Japanese. Those are also people being targeted by the new site. So far for the argument that every decent programmer has to know English, some know it but just prefer their native language and I'd argue Matz is a more than decent programmer.\n\nAs for most information being available in English and non-English information being bad, the first **public** release of ruby was in 1995 and by 2000 it was more popular than Python in Japan. The first English mailing list was created in 1999 but it took until 2002 for it to get as much messages as it's Japanese counter part (even though people from everywhere around the world could use it instead of just Japanese people). It actually took until Ruby 1.8 and 2003/2004 to get good documentation and books in English.\n\nThat said we now got decent information about it in English available but there's also a massive Japanese community with wealth of information still, as one example Matz's own blog."}, {"author_name": "\u30e9\u30d5\u30a1\u30a8\u30eb (Raphael)", "gravatar_hash": "e5f3d257f7ac7cb7253c3c7f53cf3477", "author_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/users/1942027/%E3%83%A9%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A8%E3%83%AB", "date": "Dec 19, 2014", "message": "@user2284570\n\nhow so?
