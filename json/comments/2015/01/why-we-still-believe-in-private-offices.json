In my company, there isn't anything separating us except for 5-10 feet of space.  When I started, I wasn't too keen on it but I've gotten used to it and actually prefer being around my co-workers to the isolation of a private office.\n\nThere just isn't a clear answer on this issue and it depends on the chemistry of a department.  We all get along very well in my department, but one with a toxic chemistry can end up disastrous without some form of separation, yet good employees can feel distant and demoralized without the reinforcement of social interaction within a team.  It's said that a lack of separation leads to wasted time chatting, yet it can also be said that too much separation can lead to a loss of productivity if people are less-inclined to put their heads together to solve an issue.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather work in a place where I feel like a part of something I can care about as opposed to a cog in a machine.  Even if I hate a company, feeling comfortable among a group of people can make every day tolerable and even enjoyable.  One of the reasons I own a home is so that I can have a private place to myself; I don't need a level of privacy even close to that at work, and for the most part I think that someone feeling like they need that level of isolation can be a sign that they don't enjoy their job(and aren't in a mindset where they could be as productive).  I'm not saying that this is always the case, but it's my guess from looking at my own experience.  I just can't see why a whole team of developers would even need so much as an office for each person.  Perhaps one for the technical director or sysadmin, but not for every developer.

Sometimes you need to be in the office, sometimes its important to be able to be face to face with others on your team. However, working from a Jr Security Engineer (where I really need to be in the office - but separated from the constant phone calls and other distractions) to support and system engineer roles where in reality, some people work better and function better in regards to productivity because they can stay focused on one thing and one thing only 'work'. Not driving through a nightmare of traffic to get to and from, going to constant meetings that have the same slides as the other global teams all listening and viewing the same content. When the bottom dollar comes down to the client and the engineer - the engineer facilitates the resolution and the client creates it. The employer is impartial (other than ongoing education and facilitating the trust, until the engineer builds it). This is why many organizations lose clients, because they trust the engineer and therefore employee the engineer or find a legal way to recruit the engineer outside of the NDR and NCA legal documents. It's not just software developers but those who support serious software applications that really need to be permitted to be 'innovative'. If we truly are innovative and productive - our reports compared to peers who should be doing the same will ultimately demonstrate the truth. Furthermore, to allow some to do this and to not allow others promotes a culture of favoritism and mistrust. I enjoy what I do but I feel confident I would be more productive to my team if I was able to utilize the same benefits that they can partake in (hence they are more productive). I can only suppose that management simply has either not realized this or has had a few abuse this, which ultimately can be addressed individually if was the case. Software companies I think are really missing out on true gains in metrics when innovation and productivity are suppressed in favor of coming into an office daily (we are already connected via IM and we already have audio/web conferences sometimes more than once a week). If we are already paid on salary, where is the benefit to the employer? From a business perspective, its a loss to both and a moral/trust issue to those who can, to those who cannot.

I also find that pairing and the reliance on TDD and other lean/agile practices lead me to break problems down into small pieces which reduces the amount of information I need to keep in my head and reduces the need for total concentration. Translation: I prefer open space if I'm doing pair programming (which is pretty much all the time these days).\n\nI've fortunately only spent a small part of my career in a cubicle, but it was long enough to convince me that it provides the worst of both worlds, maximizing distractions while minimizing the ability to collaborate."}, {"author_name": "Joan", "gravatar_hash": "1a3105fee1666afbf81b4640fb20ba3b", "author_url": null, "date": "Jan 19, 2015", "message": "No one has commented on the poor hearing impaired individuals that can be extremely productive if not put into a bullpen of noise.

Woodruff - including many of the same experiences, such as factory and warehouse floors and closets. Guess that is what happens when you are a contractor.
