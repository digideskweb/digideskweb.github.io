I'm curious why developer salaries seem to violate the basic economics behind supply and demand.  Generally people who are (or would be) excellent developers can go to another field and be very successful there and make a lot more money than as a developer.\n\nWhile places like NY, Seattle and Silicon Valley are hurting for developers, it's likely because many of us just don't see it as worth it to move there for what we see the jobs are offering.  While working on an interesting project with a great group of people goes a long way, we still gotta pay the bills (and the bills are much more expensive in those places).\n\nAs such, initiatives like the one noted in this blog, while seemingly well-intentioned, really seem to be a means to try to fill the demand for developers in these locations without raising the salary level."}, {"author_name": "Bethany Marzewski", "gravatar_hash": "2223637b994c460e6653d016ba972316", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 13, 2015", "message": "@TylerH Thanks for calling this to our attention!

This is exactly how it's been. There are 300k openings and not enough people to fill them because everyone wants to hire the next great software engineer and pay them like the next great burger-flipper.\n\nIf salaries would rise, more people would come to NY. The fact is that even if you're an amazing developer, it's extremely rare for a job to pay enough for you to live and raise your family in a decent area.\n\nI pay $2500/mo for a crappy studio in Manhattan. The bathroom tiles are cracked, the bathroom ceiling is peeling, a strip of the wooden floor has been torn out perpendicular to the other wood planks and anther non-matching plank was replaced to fill it. No central heating or cooling and I can always smell my neighbors smoking in their apartments. All for $2500 - which is below market for a studio in this area.\n\nIf you want a 1-bedroom in this area or another decent area, with central heating and cooling and a decent amount of space so that you can have something resembling a modern lifestyle instead of a garbage-living, that'll cost you 3.5k-4k per month.\n\nIf you have a kid, then you'll want a 2-bedroom apartment. That'll be 5k/mo.\n\nIf you have two kids, you'll want a 3-bedroom apartment. That'll be $6k/mo.\n\nOtherwise you can have 60-minute commute from a crappy area and your kids can go to crappy schools.\n\nYou'll need to have a minimum of 40-50x the monthly rent to qualify for a place. So you if you want that $6k/mo 3-bedroom apartment for your kids, you'll need to make $240k-300k/yr. But the average senior software engineer makes maybe $140k/yr here. Companies don't want to pay enough for their engineers to have a decent lifestyle, so of course they have trouble hiring engineers."}, {"author_name": "TylerH", "gravatar_hash": "1cd9e6edf9f4defca0c0d5b68ac9cded", "author_url": null, "date": "Feb 16, 2015", "message": "@Yup We should go one step further down this rabbit hole and work to get property values and cost of living reduced in such areas. $140,000/year is wealthy in America in many states, and most countries in the world.
