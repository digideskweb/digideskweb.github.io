Are there probably some sexist idiots out there hiring (or not hiring) people? Yes, there probably are, there are some sexist idiots anywhere. But I really feel like the biggest \"problem\" is *not* coders \"needing to be more proactive welcoming women\". I really don't understand \"feminists\" who feel that the world won't be perfect until perfect gender equity in all jobs (or presumably really just the *good* ones - you don't hear anyone saying we need more female garbagemen or farm grunt laborers, except as reductio ad absurdum) is reached. \n\nNow, is part of the issue cultural? Yes, you do hear plenty of stories of parents, teachers, etc., subtly (or sometimes not so subtly) encouraging boys towards science or engineering hobbies, while discouraging girls, and that is all kinds of dumb. Again, women (and girls) should totally be allowed to do what they enjoy. But if they don't enjoy programming, why should we \"proactively\" seek them out and try to brainwash them into thinking they do? That's the part that's really never made sense to me. I'm not going to \"proactively\" welcome anyone. I will happily welcome anyone of any gender, but they have to decide they want to be there, first.\n[/rant]"}, {"author_name": "Jack", "gravatar_hash": "68ff8249fcf9d2ac71e7bf91ab3f904d", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 07, 2015", "message": "Totally agree with some of your points, nemenem.

While plenty of male developers *do* genuinely welcome female developers, there can very much be a schism. In some cases you have to fit in and be \"one of the lads\" in order to have a good relationship with teammates - and that works well for some women, but is really unfair on others. I suspect it doesn't work out so well for some men who don't have a personality that fits with the prevailing group as well, but I do think it impacts women more.\n\nImagine starting a new job, and finding some or all of your new teammates seem uneasy around you, don't talk much if you're present, act differently when you're at your desk to when you're across the room, treat you differently from everyone else on the team, or possibly even seem like they're outright avoiding you or being unfriendly. Maybe one of the people doing some of these things is your direct superior. No one's being unpleasant or openly hostile to you, but something is off. And it's like that all the time.\n\nThat's not an uncommon situation for female developers. I suspect it's also not an uncommon situation for developers with other backgrounds which are different to the majority, but I'll stay focused on the topic at hand.\n\nI've experienced some of this, but nowhere nearly badly as some people I know. I didn't really get what was going on for a long time, until a conversation at my work where a few colleagues discussed whether they or their partners ever have non-mutual friends who are not their gender. The answer was overwhelmingly no - they didn't have any close opposite-gender friends, and they wouldn't expect to, and they wouldn't expect their partners to. I also had an enlightening experience when a colleague voiced feeling uncomfortable swearing around me - really glad he said something! I'm sure that most of the time those things aren't voiced, and therefore aren't dealt with.\n\nSo I suspect in a lot of cases that both men and women just aren't very used to being relaxed around people who aren't the same gender, so they end up being a bit awkward, or reverting to some sort of script for how they deal with various opposite-gender people in their lives. Other than the weird discomfort reaction, there's also the situation where the only woman on the team gets treated like everyone's little sister, or has a manager who acts like he's her father. I've heard similar complaints from men who work in female dominated environments - they've experienced hostility, or found they were working with a number of older women who tended to mother them.\n\nThe really silly thing about it all is that if both sides just relaxed and acted like normal, they'd realise there's not much difference. People are people. Geeky men and women have a lot of common interests! And in many cases I bet within an all-male or all-female team, at least some of the team will be feigning some shared interests in an attempt to fit in better, anyway.\n\nSo that's where I *do* agree with the assessment that coders need to put some effort in: if everyone took an honest look at their behaviour and social attitudes, and was willing to admit when they might not be helping the issue and then have a go at acting a tiny bit differently, it'd help. If you do that and realise you have some preconceptions about the opposite gender, then consciously try to let go of them, or at least try to act like you don't have those preconceptions - in time you won't anymore, and then you won't need to keep acting.\n\nSo it's not a case of \"male coders are doing something wrong and need to change\" - which I'm guessing is the feeling people tend to get when they read a statement like the one made. It's more \"people have some ingrained social mores and need to be conscious of them, and willing to adjust them if necessary.\" And that goes for women as well as men. The issue of course is that with so many more men in the industry already, the brunt of changing is likely to be born more by men. But it's a small, subtle, and very positive change that won't cost anyone anything. And in the meantime, the costs of this situation are coming down disproportionately on women, purely because they're by far the minority.\n\nAnd we could all certainly make sure we're supportive if people voice an interest in getting into development. I know women who have done so, and had a less-than-great reaction from people around them.\n\nWhy does it matter? Diversity of thinking is good, and especially important in a field where thinking is key to our roles. And because of the way our society works people will tend to have varied perspectives, attitudes, ideas and so on if they come from different backgrounds. Hiring women, or people from other countries, or people with different religious backgrounds, or people who have lived in different places can be a shortcut to getting a dynamic team. And as people adjust to the people around them being different, they might be less prone to demanding conformity around them the rest of the time - I bet a lot of men on male-only development teams are actually feigning some interests to fit in, or leave because they don't feel like they do fit in. It's good for people to be accepting of other people's individuality in jobs where creativity is important, creative people are often a bit odd.\n\nAnd for anyone not buying the diversity thing: if you presume the best potential developers are evenly distributed between men and women and women aren't making it into the development workforce, then we're all missing out on some great developers. And I would suggest that the women who care enough to stick around anyway are likely to be pretty passionate about their jobs and as a result may well be very good at them. If you tend not to hire them or your team tends to make them feel unwelcome resulting in them not staying long, you're possibly losing out on serious talent.\n\nI don't have data - much as I love the stuff - to back this up. I don't know if there *is* any data that would back this up. I have my experiences, and discussions with plenty of women working in IT, and also discussions with men and women in other single-gender-dominated work situations.\n\nI also realise it doesn't explain how the disparity happened in the first place. I've seen data that suggests it wasn't always this way. Perhaps more overt sexism in decades past resulted in women not being accepted into universities or jobs, or choosing to leave jobs? Or perhaps work situations that aren't family-friendly are a problem, and were probably more of a problem in the past? It's probably worth understanding in case there are serious roadblocks which will mean that no amount of effort on our part will change things very much. But even if there are, doing what we can certainly won't hurt anything, especially when it's so little effort.\n\nFor anyone who's read all that, thanks for caring enough to carry on. ;)"}, {"author_name": "Jo Douglass", "gravatar_hash": "c37796921f4e25a316cd7ae8a829413f", "author_url": "http://stackexchange.com/users/4922735/jo-douglass", "date": "Apr 07, 2015", "message": "On another topic entirely, I'm surprised BI and data warehousing scored so low on job satisfaction!

Using spaces means that you're forcing a 4-tab or 2-tab or whatever spacing on your colleagues... \n\nOnce your editors are setup, you won't even notice the difference as long as everyone uses tabs to *indent*. If you are doing positioning, you should use tabs to indent then spaces to position text. Some editors are smart enough to do this automatically; otherwise, yes, it's a hassle to spam the spacebar to position your code... In my case, we don't position code, there isn't a need to if you control the # of arguments for a method/function. Ideally there shouldn't be more than 5 arguments (some will say even 5 is too many).\n\nAs for the apparent correlation of years of experience versus tabs/spaces, I do not agree that it is an indicator of either being better... Spaces being preferred over tabs for old school coders may just mean a habitual or fanatic preference.

It *is* to be expected that the ratio is so low, it was only recently (past 5 or so years) when females were not actively dissuaded from many of the technical professions.

Now, just six months later, she has taught herself Python and has been accepted to three different coding bootcamps.

At this point, most of the women I knew as software developers are in management positions, and I chose not to go that route and go back to being a developer because it was more fun for me."}, {"author_name": "neminem", "gravatar_hash": "aca64a61990c7f3a4868b68063429683", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 08, 2015", "message": "So I'm part of the problem because I don't think that my being in the programming field *requires* that I go out and proactively find adult women in other careers, and tell them how awesome programming is and that they should change their careers? How is that in any way my business? That's what I take offense to, because that's what \"proactive\" means. \n\nIf I were a junior high, high school or even college teacher or counselor, then yes, proactively welcoming women into the field would definitely be part of my job. I had a girlfriend in college (who changed her major to cs), who admitted to hearing similar pressures against cs growing up, and that is legitimately terrible. I just take offense to being told that, as \"someone who codes\", it should be part of my job as well, or I'm \"part of the problem.\" That's all. \n\nNow, startup culture is totally different from programming culture, and you're *definitely* never going to achieve gender parity there, even if you did achieve it with software development generally. Startup culture isn't even about programming, it's about being willing to work at a high-stress job for months to years for little pay but the promise of high future reward. It's your classic high risk/high reward job, which attracts a lot more guys than girls for mostly-non-culture-specific reasons (note: I'm a guy, a developer, and have no interest in ever working for a startup, for the same reason). \n\nCould the \"culture\" especially at startups still be more welcoming (note: not \"proactively\" welcoming) to the occasional female who bucked the trend and did want to work in such an environment? Yes, it definitely could. There's a difference between refusing to admit that people of different genders are, on average, different (sorry, that's just fact), and admitting that, but being fully welcoming to those people who are unlike the average in some way."}, {"author_name": "KJ Price", "gravatar_hash": "bf9f954033c4ac47a9763b6860364624", "author_url": null, "date": "Apr 08, 2015", "message": "Three people in North Korea responded?

This meant that access to a computer was limited by your abilities, and at the level that you need to be to have access to computers, the gender gap is lesser (still there, but lesser...)\n- the rise in the trend of women between 1970 and 1984 could be because of computers being more available. This seems contradictory to the point above, until you look at the ranks in academia, where the very top people are mostly male. ~1984 is probably when the access level to computers became lower than the artificial academic ceiling for women.\n- a lot of developers gained interest in computers due to computer games, computer games only really started booming in the late 80s, guys play games more than girls (there's a study on men preferring routine, and girls dislike repetitive tasks: oem.bmj.com/content/early/2011/04/11/oem.2010.064097.short?q=w_oem_ahead_tab and games are *definitely* repetitive)\n- If we look at the numbers, both men and women developers grew in population; Men population just grew quicker. I believe it will start to even out now with women catching up.\n\nLastly, I would like to say that... There *NO NEED* to make everything exactly equal forcefully. The most important thing we need to do is to tell our kids that all options are open, and they can pick whichever one they want.

Well said.\n\nI have a lot of women in my organization world-wide.  Considering my top performers vs bottom, I don't think there is much disparity between genders, regardless of country.  So, at least from my experience, I agree with your statement about \"the best potential developers are evenly distributed between men and women\".\n\nBut thinking back of my tenure at a former, equally large company, women were almost unheard of in IT.  That company had a more decentralized culture where the manufacturing plants had more control, hence there was less corporate oversight.  My point being that maybe women would have better success at more centralized companies, as the culture is more open.... and often more experienced.  My own theory is that experience leads to more self-confidence which leads to more openness and more acceptance of people and cultures dissimilar to your own.\n\nAnother point to consider is that the design and execution of the product or service of the company you work for, benefits when the company culture better matches the end-customer culture.  In other words, if your product or service is used by a lot of women, I think the insights that women bring to the planning, design and execution can greatly benefit the company."}, {"author_name": "Rakesh", "gravatar_hash": "fd836820fb4cf255849aaba3fd37e724", "author_url": "http://netjobsguru.com", "date": "Apr 12, 2015", "message": "Very interesting post:)"}, {"author_name": "Asl\u0131", "gravatar_hash": "002f4edf471b518d2f71ed6474d0f3a1", "author_url": "http://www.eciltbakimi.com/", "date": "Apr 14, 2015", "message": "I'd rather tabs to spaces..."}, {"author_name": "preet", "gravatar_hash": "09073b56977d081520cf12ba11376ec8", "author_url": "http://raagcafe.com", "date": "Apr 26, 2015", "message": "Great post."}, {"author_name": "raag", "gravatar_hash": "09073b56977d081520cf12ba11376ec8", "author_url": "http://Sajfm.com", "date": "Apr 26, 2015", "message": "Awesome Post. keep it up"}]}
