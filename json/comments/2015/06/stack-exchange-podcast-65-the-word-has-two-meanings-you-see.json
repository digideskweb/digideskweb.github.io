SO isn't intended to be a place to ask questions, it is a place to get answers. A simple example of what I mean is the way duplicate postings are handled. On SO we actively try to prevent these. If our goal was to answer questions then that wouldn't make any sense. Since the ultimate goal is more about providing answers for questions that weren't asked (only searched for) it is perfectly reasonable. Asking questions is simply a means to an end. \n\nNow, given that our goal is to provide answers, why would we want a non English speaker to go around posing poorly written questions? This only degrades the site. We're better off not allowing non English speakers to ask questions to begin with and waiting for an English speaker to come along and write the question in a way that is more easily understandable for everyone (and likely has a few more choice keywords mentioned than a non English speaker would've used)."}, {"author_name": "GiantCowFilms", "gravatar_hash": "e618a333f4dfb48f6b83a4f99c8061bb", "author_url": "http://GiantCowFilms.com", "date": "Jun 18, 2015", "message": "I think to build on the idea of how many people helped, you should add a views sort with the vote and date option to the profile.
