Somebody took enough pity on me to answer - and did it in English, probably because he thought that a person with my atrocious skills of writing Russian won't understand him else. I didn't get it to work well, and when a few years later I had the same encoding problem with the Sony e-reader, didn't even try posting for help anywhere. \n\nI use each of my three main languages daily, if one gets left out, it's my mother tongue. I also sometimes try to read texts in languages I don't know (as long as I know the alphabet) and get the gist of it - for fun. So I'd say I have way more motivation and experience of immersing myself in foreign languages than the average person. And still, *getting technical help in a language I speak badly turned out to be difficult, time-consuming, fruitless and frustrating* to the point where I preferred to leave the problem unsolved. \n\nIf that's the experience for me, it's unlikely to be any better for the millions of Russian (or Portuguese, or whoever) programmers who don't speak English well. Sure, we could step on a high pulpit and tell them all to learn English ASAP, because that's how they have to be.
